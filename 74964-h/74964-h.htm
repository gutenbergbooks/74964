  <h2 class="sp3 ac" title="PREFACE" style="margin-bottom:3.6ex;"><span
  class="x-larger">PREFACE</span></h2>

  <p>In this volume of the "Cambridge Natural History" the author has attempted to meet a need which
  he believes to be somewhat widely felt. Recognising the fact that there is at the present time an
  abundance of popular, or only slightly scientific, works on Birds, some of which touch but
  superficially upon the individual species composing the various groups, as regards their plumage
  or habits, while others pay little or no attention to correctness of Classification, he has
  essayed the difficult and apparently unattempted task of including in some six hundred pages a
  short description of the majority of the forms in many of the Families, and of the most typical or
  important of the innumerable species included in the large Passerine Order. Prefixed to each group
  is a brief summary of the Structure and Habits; a few further particulars of the same nature being
  subsequently added where necessary, with a statement of the main Fossil forms as yet recorded.</p>

  <p>Thus it is hoped that the work may be of real use, not only to the tyro in Ornithology, but
  also to the traveller or resident in foreign parts interested in the subject, who, without time or
  opportunity for referring to the works of specialists, may yet need the aid of a concise account
  of the species likely to cross his path.</p>

  <p>An introductory chapter has been written, to meet the claims of the present day, on the
  external and to a limited extent on the internal structure of Birds, with short paragraphs on
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagevi"><span class="smaller">{vi}</span></span>Classification,
  Geographical Distribution, and Migration, and a "Terminology" of the subject.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the scheme of the Series generally, the order followed runs from the lowest
  forms and the Ratite Birds upwards; the Carinate Birds being divided, after Dr. Gadow's plan, into
  two Brigades or main sections, and these again into Legions, Orders, and so forth. It should,
  however, be understood that the <i>Species</i> of each Genus are often merely placed in the most
  convenient order; and that, where a geographical range is given, it does not follow that it is
  unbroken from end to end.</p>

  <p>In descriptions of colour, the names used for tints in the British Museum Catalogue of Birds
  have been commonly adopted, or for British species those in Mr. Howard Saunders' <i>Manual of
  British Birds</i>.</p>

  <p>Various subjects of a highly technical, or at least of a special character, have purposely been
  avoided in the main, as unfitted to the scope of the work; such are, Variation and Hybrids, with
  their accompaniments of Dimorphism, Dichromatism, and the like; Myology; Mechanism of Flight and
  the supposed Lines of Flight on Migration; the Classifications of Linn&aelig;us and the older writers;
  and the Strickland Code of Ornithological Nomenclature. For these Professor Newton's <i>Dictionary
  of Birds</i>, and especially the Introduction to it, may be consulted; besides a multitude of
  other works.</p>

  <p>The woodcuts have been chiefly supplied by Mr. G. E. Lodge; but a few illustrations have been
  utilized from other sources.</p>

  <p>The author does not hold himself responsible for the fact of the Family names being in Roman in
  place of Italic type, nor for the dissociation of the vowels in the diphthongs; in these minor
  points he personally differs from the writers of the former volumes, though he agrees with the
  wish of his Editors for uniformity.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagevii"><span class="smaller">{vii}</span></span></div>

  <p>In conclusion, he must take the opportunity of acknowledging the invaluable assistance afforded
  by Mr. Howard Saunders, who carefully went over the whole of the proofs, while Dr. R. B. Sharpe
  was kind enough to do the same; nor must he fail to record his indebtedness to Professor Newton,
  Mr. Sclater, Dr. Gadow, Mr. Ogilvie Grant, and many others, not to mention the innumerable authors
  without whose previous labours to write a book of this description would be a well-nigh impossible
  task. Dr. Stejneger's Volume on Birds in the <i>Standard Natural History</i> should be mentioned
  in particular.</p>

  <p>Since the text has been printed off, several new species have been described, and of these it
  is necessary to mention at least the following;&ndash;</p>

  <p><i>Archaeopteryx siemensi</i>, from Solenhofen, where the original form was
  obtained.&ndash;(Dames.)</p>

  <p><i>Euryapteryx exilis</i> (Dinornithidae); a new genus, <i>Anomalornis</i>, is also proposed
  for <i>Anomalopteryx</i> (preoccupied).&ndash;(Hutton.)</p>

  <p><i>Ammoperdix cholmleyi</i> (Phasianidae), from Suakin.&ndash;(Ogilvie-Grant.)</p>

  <p><i>Cepphus snowi</i> (Alcidae), from the Kurile Is.&ndash;(Stejneger.) The range of <i>C.
  columba</i> will now be "Bering Sea to California;" and of <i>C. carbo</i> "North-East Asia and
  Japanese Seas."</p>

  <p><i>Podoces pleskii</i> (Corvidae), from East Persia.&ndash;(Zarudny.)</p>

  <p>Some new fossil forms from Patagonia.&ndash;(Mercerat.)</p>

  <p>Mr. F. E. Blaauw has published a Monograph of the Cranes, and Mr. C. W. de Vis has described
  the eggs and young of <i>Salvadorina</i> (Anatidae).</p>

  <p class="sp5">In all these cases the <i>Zoological Record</i> for 1897 may be consulted.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">INTRODUCTION</span></p>

  <p><b>Definition.</b>&ndash;"A Bird is a feathered biped." This popular saying undoubtedly
  furnishes a definition in the world of to-day, since no other existing creature has a clothing of
  feathers, and even the word "biped" is thus superfluous.</p>

  <p>The above should, however, be somewhat expanded, in order to shew in greater detail the
  differences between Birds and other Vertebrata. Care must nevertheless be taken to avoid the fault
  common to many modern definitions, of giving an abstract of the main characteristics of the
  object, rather than a clear guide to distinction.</p>

  <p>Dr. Gadow<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> defines Birds as "oviparous,
  warm-blooded, amniotic Vertebrates, which have their anterior extremities transformed into wings.
  Metacarpus and fingers carrying feathers or quills. With an intertarsal joint. Not more than four
  toes, of which the first is the hallux."</p>

  <p>Much of this the beginner might well postpone, his attention being solely drawn to the external
  characters; though of course those that are internal are by no means to be subsequently neglected.
  Indeed no satisfactory progress can be made in the serious study of Ornithology, or the Science of
  Birds, without a competent knowledge of their Anatomy and Development; while, though at present
  comparatively few fossil remains of Birds have been found, some of them are of the highest
  importance, and there is every probability of future discoveries throwing much light not only on
  the mutual relationships of Birds among themselves, but also on their connexion with the
  <i>Reptilia</i>. Birds are, in fact, only extremely modified Reptiles, the two Classes forming the
  <i>Sauropsida</i> of Huxley, one of his three primary divisions of Vertebrata. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page2"><span class="smaller">{2}</span></span>The aid of the Palaeontologist
  and Geologist must thus be called in to clear up many problems which present themselves to the
  Ornithologist who does not content himself with examining existing forms of life alone.
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page23">23</a></span>) from the Jurassic
  System is the oldest Bird known, nor are any other pre-Tertiary forms recorded, save a small
  number from the rocks of the Cretaceous Epoch, the chief of which are the so-called
  <i>Odontornithes</i>, or toothed species of America (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page45">45</a></span>).</p>

  <p>The following paragraphs on the structure of Birds will help to explain the systematic account
  in the later chapters.</p>

  <p><b>Feathers.</b>&ndash;Returning to the outward character denoted by the popular saying with
  which we began, the Feathers<a id="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> constituting the plumage
  may not inconveniently be first considered. The general belief that they grow from almost every
  part of a Bird's body, as do hairs in most Mammals, is erroneous; for, almost without exception,
  they grow in certain definite tracts called <i>pterylae</i>, the intervening spaces, whether they
  be wholly bare or covered with down, being termed <i>apteria</i>. The arrangement of these patches
  is at times of considerable assistance in determining a Bird's affinities; and the subject may be
  studied in Nitzsch's <i>Pterylographie</i><a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> or in a
  shorter form in Dr. Gadow's article "Pterylosis" in Professor Newton's <i>Dictionary of
  Birds</i>.</p>

  <p>A feather originates thus. A conical papilla arises in the <i>derma</i> and pushes up the
  <i>epidermis</i>, a depression forming meanwhile around the base; subsequently the derma supplies
  a nutritive pulp, while part of the epidermal layer is converted into a tuft of stiff rays,
  meeting and forming a short tube below; these thereafter burst their covering and protrude as the
  <i>rami</i> or barbs, on which, apparently by secondary splitting, are commonly produced
  <i>radii</i> or barbules. In this state we have a plumule or "down-feather"; but in the case of
  the feathers that have "webs" or "vanes" (<i>vexilla</i>) often called contour feathers
  (<i>pennae</i> or <i>plumae</i>), a fresh papilla forms at a deeper level, so that the earlier
  structure is thrust forward and eventually drops off from the apex of the later. Meanwhile the
  "dorsal" portions of <span class="pagenum" id="page3"><span class="smaller">{3}</span></span>the
  barrel or quill (<i>calamus</i> or <i>scapus</i>) at the base of the tuft of rays have elongated
  into a principal shaft (<i>rhachis</i>); this is generally accompanied by a secondary "aftershaft"
  (<i>hyporhachis</i>), originating from the "ventral" side, which in the Emeu and Cassowary rivals
  the shaft itself in size. On the rhachis a double series of <i>lamellae</i> or barbs are
  developed, carrying a similar double series of barbules, much as in the down-feather, but the
  barbules again give rise to barbicels (<i>cilia</i>), which in the distal rows usually terminate
  in hooklets (<i>hamuli</i>). These catch in the folded margins of the next proximal row, and a
  firm surface is thus secured. An after-shaft never, and a down-feather rarely, possesses
  barbicels; while in some cases by the absence of these and part of the barbules a "disconnected"
  web and a "decomposed" feather are formed, as in the decorative tufts of many species. The barbs
  may even be absent, as in the wing-quills of Cassowaries, the wires of Birds-of-Paradise, the
  "bristle-feathers" at the gape of Night-jars or the eyelashes of Hornbills. In the hackles of
  <i>Gallus</i> (Fowl), and the secondaries or even the tail-feathers of <i>Ampelis</i> (Waxwing),
  the tip of the rhachis is flattened and wax-like; and similar structures are observable elsewhere.
  In the newly-hatched young the down is often partly or entirely suppressed, but in certain Birds
  this suppression is temporary, and a thick coat grows after a few days. "Powder-down" feathers are
  those which never develop beyond the early stage, and continually disintegrate at the tip into
  bluish- or greyish-white powder; they occur in the <i>Tinamidae</i>, <i>Ardeidae</i>,
  <i>Rhinochetidae</i>, <i>Eurypygidae</i>, <i>Mesitidae</i>, <i>Accipitres</i> and <i>Psittaci</i>,
  in <i>Podargus</i>, <i>Coracias</i>, <i>Leptosoma</i>, <i>Gymnoderus</i> and <i>Artamus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Colour.</b>&ndash;The colour of Feathers is due to one of three causes. First, an actual
  pigment<a id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> may be present in certain corpuscles, or in
  diffused solution, and the tint does not then vary according to the incidence of the light.
  Secondly, it may arise from a pigment overlaid by colourless structures in the form of ridges or
  imbedded polygonal bodies; here, if the vanes are scraped or held up to the light, the pigmentary
  colour alone is visible.<a id="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Thirdly, the colour may be
  iridescent or prismatic; that is, a blackish <span class="pagenum" id="page4"><span
  class="smaller">{4}</span></span>pigment may lie beneath a surface, which, whether polished,
  ridged, or pitted, acts as a series of prisms, causing the hue to vary according to the relative
  position of the spectator's eye and the light. This is seen in a remarkable degree in
  Humming-birds.<a id="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Not uncommonly the vanes of feathers have an appearance like watered silk, due to very
  indistinct transverse striations. In regard to plumage generally, it may be noticed that the
  markings on a feather frequently indicate the age of a bird. In some the immature plumage is
  characterised by light-coloured tips to the feathers, which are lost as maturity is reached. In
  other groups, and especially in most of the <i>Accipitres</i> or Diurnal Birds of Prey, the
  markings of the immature bird are generally longitudinal, and in the adult transverse. In nearly
  all these cases the change is effected at the first moult. Females and young are usually duller
  than males, but in some cases, such as <i>Phalaropus</i> (<i>Limicolae</i>) and <i>Eclectus</i>
  (<i>Psittaci</i>), the hen-birds are the more brightly coloured.</p>

  <p><b>Moult.</b>&ndash;Referring to <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page2">2</a></span>, it should
  be remarked that, after the production of a feather, the formative substances become for a while
  dormant, but awake to renewed activity, if accidental or periodical loss needs to be made good;
  and so we naturally arrive at the phenomena of the annual Moult, which is often double, that is,
  occurring towards autumn, and again in spring.</p>

  <p>Though some Birds do not lose their quill-feathers the first year, they normally gain a winter
  plumage&ndash;differing in colour from the summer garb&ndash;by moulting or shedding their
  feathers. The wing-quills, and even those of the tail, are ordinarily discarded in pairs, though
  not quite simultaneously; but most <i>Anatidae</i> (Swans, Geese and Ducks), and apparently the
  <i>Phoenicopteridae</i> (Flamingos), lose all the former at once,<a id="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and with them the power of flight; while in the first-named Family
  the males of many species assume for several weeks a dress resembling that of the female, and are
  said to undergo an "eclipse." Young birds moult, as a rule, somewhat later than adults, but in the
  typical <i>Gallinae</i> the original quills are shed before the possessors are fully grown, and
  are succeeded by others of proportionately increased size, the power of flight being attained very
  early.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page5"><span class="smaller">{5}</span></span></div>

  <p>The additional or spring moult affects the smaller feathers only, while it is still doubtful
  how far changes of colour are clue to a mere dropping off of the fringe of barbicels. The
  decorative plumes of the males of many species are gained at the vernal moult. The double process
  is certainly not diagnostic of Families or even Genera, except in isolated cases; as an instance,
  however, the Larks have one moult, the Pipits and Wagtails two.</p>

  <p>In such cases as Swallows and Diurnal Birds of Prey generally, the plumage is not changed till
  after the migration; in the Ptarmigan there is a triple moult, the breeding-suit being changed
  first to a greyish habit and then to a white; in Penguins the feathers of the wing come off in
  flakes.<a id="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Skeleton, Digestive Organs, etc.</b>&ndash;The plumage, however, though often striking, and
  of undoubted utility as a non-conductor of heat and a protection against wet, plays a subordinate
  part in determining the relationships of the larger groups of Birds. For this we need the
  assistance of anatomy, if indeed we do not rely upon it almost entirely. It will be well before
  starting to state that structures which are morphologically similar, that is, which have a like
  origin in the embryo, are termed "homologous," while those which perform the same physiological
  functions are "analogous," the word in its strictest sense implying initial diversity.</p>

  <p>Any standard work on Vertebrate Anatomy ought to furnish a concise account of the bony
  framework or Skeleton of a Bird, but it will be convenient here to follow mainly the treatment of
  Dr. Gadow, in Prof. Newton's <i>Dictionary of Birds</i>, pp. 848-867.</p>

  <p>According to this authority the Axial Skeleton consists of the Skull and Vertebral Column; the
  Appendicular Skeleton of the Ribs, the Sternum, the Limbs and their Arches, the Hyoid Apparatus or
  framework of the tongue, and the Jaws.</p>

  <p>1. The Vertebral Column, which protects the Spinal Cord, is composed of a variable number of
  cervical, dorsal, sacral or pelvic, and caudal vertebrae; that is, those of the neck, back, loins
  and tail respectively. The first cervical vertebra, which bears the head, articulating with it by
  a single condyle, is called the Atlas; the second, on which it turns, the Axis; the succeeding
  cervicals <span class="pagenum" id="page6"><span class="smaller">{6}</span></span>present a
  considerable number of processes or projections, which protect certain blood-vessels, and serve
  for the attachment of the muscles which turn the flexible neck. The dorsal vertebrae follow, and
  some not unfrequently coalesce with each other, but this is always so with the sacrals, and in
  nearly all existing Birds with the terminal portion of the caudals, which are fused together to
  form a "pygostyle" or upright triangular plate to carry the tail-feathers.<a id="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, so far as is known, stands alone in having
  all the caudal vertebrae free.</p>

  <p>A typical vertebra consists of a centrum, and an arch, with articular surfaces for two ribs,
  and is called heterocoelous when the facets, or connecting surfaces, are saddle-shaped, a
  condition characteristic of, and restricted to, Birds. It is amphicoelous, or biconcave, when each
  end is hollowed, as in the dorsal region of <i>Ichthyornis</i> and probably in
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i>; procoelous, when concave in front (as is common in Reptiles); opisthocoelous
  when concave behind (as in many Mammals).</p>

  <p>2. The Ribs are doubly attached to the vertebrae by a head (<i>capitulum</i>) and a knob
  (<i>tuberculum</i>); and have a neck, a dorsal, and a ventral portion, each dorsal section (save
  on the last rib) possessing an "uncinate process" or thin, bony posterior projection, except in
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and the <i>Palamedeidae</i>. Should the ventral piece articulate with the
  sternum the rib is "true," otherwise it is called "false"; moreover the cervical and frequently
  the post-thoracic ribs are fused with the cervical vertebrae and the ilia respectively.</p>

  <p>3. The Breast-bone (<i>Sternum</i>) presents two different styles&ndash;according to whether it
  exhibits on its ventral surface a median ridge or keel (<i>carina</i>), or not. In the former
  case, which is that of by far the greater number of existing Birds (hence termed
  <i>Carinatae</i>), the keel is of variable size, being correlated with the power of flight. It is
  exceedingly deep in the Swifts, Humming Birds, and certain Petrels, but dwindles almost to
  disappearance in some flightless forms such as the Dodo, the Kakapo (<i>Stringops</i>), the
  extinct New Zealand Goose (<i>Cnemiornis</i>), and a good many Rails.</p>

  <p>The absence of a keel is characteristic of the other and smaller group of Birds, made up of the
  Ostrich, Rhea, Emeu and Cassowary, Moa and Kiwi, which from the resemblance the sternum thus bears
  to a flat-bottomed boat (<i>ratis</i>) are known as <i>Ratitae</i>. Whether keeled or not, the
  breast-bone affords a surface of attachment to the principal muscles of the fore-limbs, and its
  anterior end supports the coracoids, as in Fig. 2. Various processes are in most cases developed
  on the sides of the sternum itself, behind its junction with the ribs, especially towards the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page8"><span class="smaller">{8}</span></span>posterior portion, where
  they often take the form of prolongations, the extremities of which occasionally meet and enclose
  what are called <i>fenestrae</i>; but these are unimportant when compared with the features
  presented by the anterior part.</p>

  <p>4. The Pectoral Arch, or Shoulder-Girdle, consists of three pairs of bones, the Coracoids, the
  Scapulae or Shoulder-blades, and the Clavicles or  Collar-bones, the last two usually coalescing
  in the median line into a <span class="sans fwb">V</span>-shaped or <span class="sans
  fwb">U</span>-shaped Furcula (the well-known Merry-thought); but in some groups, as certain
  Parrots, the clavicles are practically absent, while in others, as several Owls, they do not
  unite. The furcula often ossifies firmly with the anterior portion of the keel, and in
  <i>Fregata</i>, <i>Didus</i> and the <i>Ratitae</i>, the coracoids and scapulae are fused
  together.</p>

  </div>

  <p>5. The Anterior Limbs, or Wings, are composed of the Humerus, or upper arm-bone, the Ulna and
  Radius (making the fore-arm), the Carpus or wrist, the Metacarpus and Digits, corresponding with
  the hand and fingers. The first of the three metacarpals bears the Pollex, or thumb, with one or
  two <span class="pagenum" id="page9"><span class="smaller">{9}</span></span>phalanges (joints);
  the second the Index, representing man's first finger, with two or three joints; the third a weak
  digit with only one phalanx, except in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, where there are four. The
  <i>Casuarii</i> and <i>Apteryges</i> possess an index only, which in the <i>Sphenisci</i> fuses
  with the pollex. The basal joint of this is the normal place of attachment of the "bastard wing"
  (<i>alula spuria</i>). <i>Archaeopteryx</i> had claws on all its fingers, but in recent Birds they
  occur on the first two only, being functionless in the adult. Wing-spurs arise from the carpal and
  metacarpal bones.</p>

  <p>6. The Pelvic Arch consists of the Ilium, Ischium, and Os pubis, these three paired bones
  meeting from each side at the cup (<i>acetabulum</i>) that receives the head of the femur, and
  coalescing early in life; while the <i>incisura ischiadica</i> or notch between the ischium and
  the ilium becomes an inclosed space (<i>foramen</i>) in all Birds except the <i>Ratitae</i> and
  <i>Crypturi</i>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>7. The Posterior Limbs, or Legs, are composed of the Femur or thigh, the Tibia and Fibula,
  making the shank or "drumstick," and the bones of the Foot. The thigh, however, being hidden by
  the plumage, the shank of a Bird might easily be taken for the thigh, and the metatarsus (the
  cannon-bone of some) for the shank. The tibia and fibula commonly unite to some extent, and the
  former, as it now exists in adult Birds, is strictly a "tibio-tarsus," since with it is fused the
  proximal portion of the originally existing tarsal elements. Similarly the distal tarsal <span
  class="pagenum" id="page10"><span class="smaller">{10}</span></span>elements unite with the
  metatarsus, which is therefore properly a "tarso-metatarsus," though often called merely "tarsus"
  by ornithologists. This arises from a fusion of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones,
  which in the adult (except among the <i>Sphenisci</i> and to some extent in <i>Psittaci</i>) do
  not lie in the same plane; the middle one having its upper end thrust backward and its lower end
  forward in the course of growth to maturity. The fifth metatarsal practically disappears, while
  the first remains more or less separate, and lies behind the distal portion of the other
  metatarsals.</p>

  <p>Of the toes the fifth is not traceable in Birds; the first is often aborted, but the second
  only in <i>Struthio</i>, and to a less extent in <i>Ceyx</i> and <i>Alcyone</i>, and the fourth
  (nearly) in <i>Cholornis</i>. The hallux, or hind toe, has two phalanges, the second digit three,
  the third four, and the fourth five; <i>Cypselus</i> and <i>Panyptila</i> (Swifts), however, are
  exceptions, and possess only three in each of the anterior toes, while the <i>Caprimulginae</i>
  (true Nightjars) and <i>Pteroclidae</i> (Sand-Grouse) have only four joints on the outer. In Owls
  the fourth digit is reversible at will, the same being true to a less extent of the
  <i>Musophagidae</i> (Plantain-eaters) and <i>Leptosoma</i> (akin to the Roller); when this
  condition is permanent, as in the <i>Cuculidae</i>, <i>Psittaci</i> and <i>Pici</i> the foot is
  termed zygodactylous. In <i>Trogones</i> the second toe is reversed (heterodactylous).
  <i>Colius</i> can turn the first toe forward and the fourth backward, while certain Swifts, and to
  a less degree some Nightjars, have the whole number permanently pointing to the front
  (pamprodactylous). Membranes more or less connecting the anterior digits produce a webbed or
  swimming foot, even the hallux being united with the rest in the <i>Steganopodes</i>. The hind-toe
  is often elevated, or higher than its fellows, when it is commonly reduced and sometimes lacks a
  nail. The Ostrich has little or no claw on the outer toe, while that of the third toe is toothed
  or serrated in a considerable number of Birds, but this is a character of very slight
  importance.</p>

  <p>The covering of the metatarsus is usually "scutellated," but when the <i>scutellae</i>, or
  scales, which may be oblong or polygonal, are smaller than usual&ndash;and generally
  hexagonal&ndash;it is called reticulated. In some cases the surface becomes nearly or quite smooth
  ("ocreated" or "booted"), or more or less granulated.</p>

  <p>8. The structure of the Skull is a study in itself and affords <span class="pagenum"

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Bill, or Beak, is composed of an upper jaw or maxilla, and an under jaw or mandible. From
  the figure it will be seen that "maxilla" is not strictly the whole upper portion, though the term
  is thus used for convenience, as is the plural "mandibles" for the two jaws when mentioned
  simultaneously. The "rhamphotheca," or horny sheath, may be simple (undivided), or compound, that
  is, made of several distinct pieces. In the <i>Anseres</i> the covering is soft with a horny
  (corneous) tip or "nail"; in the <i>Limicolae</i> it varies extremely, producing a hard pickaxe,
  as in the Oystercatcher, or a delicate sensory organ as in the Snipe and Woodcock. The
  rhamphotheca at times has extraordinary outgrowths, as in the Hornbills, Sheathbills, and
  elsewhere. In the <i>Accipitres</i>, or Diurnal Birds of Prey, and most <i>Psittaci</i>, the base
  is soft and becomes a "cere," while the similar formation in the <i>Columbae</i> is due to a
  swelling of the <i>operculum</i> or covering of the nostrils. This operculum, moreover, may be
  leathery (coriaceous), as in the <i>Charadriidae</i>, <i>Trochilidae</i> and so forth, or rolled
  up, as in <i>Rhinochetus</i>; it may even result in a short soft tube, as in <i>Caprimulgus</i>,
  or in the hard double tube which gives the name of <i>Tubinares</i> to the Petrels. "Impervious"
  nostrils are those with a septum, or division, between the nasal cavities, "pervious" <span
  class="pagenum" id="page12"><span class="smaller">{12}</span></span>those with none. The narrow
  slit-like or entirely closed nostrils of the <i>Steganopodes</i> should also be mentioned.</p>

  <p>The form of the bill varies from the "spoon" of <i>Platalea</i> and <i>Eurynorhynchus</i>
  (spatulate) to the "arch" of <i>Numenius</i>, the scissors of <i>Rhynchops</i>, the "wedge" of
  <i>Picus</i>, the big rounded feature of the <i>Psittaci</i>, and so forth; but for details the
  characters of the several Families must be consulted, as also for helmets, shields, horns, knobs,
  and peculiarities due to the elongation, distorting or crossing of the mandibles. These, too, are
  often notched, serrated, lobed or "festooned," or emarginate (slightly indented); the curious
  transverse serrations or <i>lamellae</i> of the beak in <i>Anseres</i>, and the somewhat similar
  sifting apparatus in <i>Phoenicopterus</i>, <i>Prion</i> and <i>Anastomus</i> being especially
  remarkable. Teeth were probably lost by Birds before Tertiary times, but were possessed at least
  by <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, <i>Hesperornis</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i>. The so-called "egg-tooth" of
  embryos is merely a calcareous protuberance on the upper surface of the bill, which is cast after
  being used to crack the shell.</p>

  <p>9. The organs of deglutition and digestion begin with the tongue, which is subject to much
  variation of structure, according to the different groups of Birds, and is of course correlative
  with their habits. It has little connexion with taste, though often of assistance in obtaining
  nutriment. To this follows the gullet (<i>oesophagus</i>), which in many cases has an enlargement
  forming the crop (<i>ingluvies</i>), wherein the food may be temporarily retained before passing
  into the stomach, the last-named always having an antechamber (<i>proventriculus</i>) where
  digestion is largely accomplished, in front of the gizzard (<i>ventriculus</i>). This has
  frequently strong muscular walls, and its action is often assisted by the mechanical process of
  comminution performed by stones, grit or sand, swallowed for that purpose. The stomach is
  succeeded by the intestines, which in most cases have a pair of blind-sacs (<i>caeca</i>) attached
  to them, often acting as aids to digestion, though these are not always functional, and are absent
  in many Birds, while in others they attain a very large size, their condition being in consequence
  of some importance as a systematic character.</p>

  <p>10. The organs of voice in Birds have long attracted special interest from the loud cries which
  some utter, and the melody with which others are gifted.  Setting aside the part played by <span
  class="pagenum" id="page13"><span class="smaller">{13}</span></span>the <i>trachea</i> or windpipe
  in supplying air to the lungs, its formation is worthy of attention. Its upper end consists of the
  <i>larynx</i>, and it passes down the neck as a flexible tube, formed by a continuous succession
  of bony rings connected by membrane, until it bifurcates into two <i>bronchi</i>, which open into
  the lungs. A common feature, found in many groups not nearly allied, is the dilatation of a
  portion, generally near the middle, while a remarkable modification is exhibited by the males of
  many of the Duck-tribe, some of the lowest rings being fused together and forming what is known as
  the <i>bulla ossea</i> or "labyrinth." In other <i>Anatidae</i> (some of the Swans), and some of
  the Cranes, the trachea enters the keel of the sternum; but a not unfrequent modification, usually
  confined to the male sex, often occurs elsewhere, when the windpipe is looped back upon itself.
  All these arrangements, however they may affect the sounds uttered by Birds, do not in themselves
  constitute the voice organ of most. That is reserved for the <i>syrinx</i>, a peculiarity of the
  Class <i>Aves</i>, consisting of the lower end of the trachea and the adjoining part of the
  bronchial tubes; and the varied modulations are effected by means of muscles attached thereto.
  These voice-muscles may be wholly absent or of the simplest character, but they attain their
  highest perfection in the <i>Passeres</i>, and especially in the large group of them known as
  <i>Oscines</i>, where there are often five or seven pairs. In this group the lowest four or five
  tracheal rings are solidly fused into a little bony box communicating with the bronchi; the first
  and second bronchial rings (or in this part often semi-rings) being closely attached to the
  trachea, and the spaces between the second and third and the third and fourth being generally
  closed by an outer tympaniform (drum-like) membrane, while the rest of the semi-rings of the
  bronchi are closed by the inner tympaniform membrane. It should be clearly understood that all the
  notes emitted by Birds are produced by the above structures only, and that the tongue has nothing
  to do with their utterance, except, possibly, in the case of the sounds that Parrots (but not
  other birds) are taught to produce.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&ndash;The Classification of Birds is still in a condition of
  uncertainty, notwithstanding the many schemes successively propounded during more than two
  centuries. To dwell upon them here would be impossible, and it is only practicable <span
  class="pagenum" id="page14"><span class="smaller">{14}</span></span>to trace in the briefest way
  the line which has led to the most recent attempts, and to name those whose researches have
  produced the results which may be fairly regarded as attained. First among them is Nitzsch
  (1806-1840), to whom followed Merrem (1812-1817), and after a few years L'Herminier (1827). These
  three worked quite independently, and in their lifetime little notice was taken of their labours;
  for, though there were good ornithologists among their contemporaries, little value was then set
  upon internal characters in this connexion. An improvement took place when the great Johannes
  M&uuml;ller (1846, 1847) published his scheme for grouping the <i>Passeres</i>, which, though based on
  purely anatomical facts, was almost immediately accepted, chiefly through the simultaneous
  exertions of Dr. Cabanis, by systematists of the Old School. For twenty years no advance was made,
  for the morphological researches of Parker were not directly taxonomical; but Huxley (1867, 1868)
  started what was practically a new line of investigation, though it subsequently appeared that up
  to a certain point it had been already suggested by Dr. Cornay (1842-1847). The impetus thus given
  was fortunately sustained, Huxley's example being followed by Dr. Murie, and by two promising men,
  A. Garrod and W. A. Forbes, both of whom died at an early age, leaving their mark in work which,
  though much of it was crude, was that of true genius. Mr. Sclater (1880) has tried to bring the
  results of the whole four into harmony with pre-existing views, and a similar attempt was that of
  Dr. Stejneger (1885); but all were overshadowed by the monumental performance of Prof. F&uuml;rbringer,
  whose <i>Untersuchungen zur Morphologie und Systematik der V&ouml;gel</i>, completed in 1888, must ever
  remain a record of unexampled labour, while his considerations on the derivation of Birds from
  Reptiles, and of the later groups of Birds from the earlier, whether his results be right or
  wrong, are of the utmost importance to the ornithologist. During the progress of this work the
  author was in frequent communication with Dr. Gadow, himself engaged on the ornithological portion
  of Bronn's <i>Thier-Reich</i>, and thus the opinions of each were in many cases mutually affected.
  Dr. Gadow, on the completion of his undertaking, propounded a scheme of classification, which is
  followed, with some slight modifications, in the present volume (see foregoing table)&ndash;it
  being, of course, understood that a linear arrangement is, <span class="pagenum" id="page15"><span
  class="smaller">{15}</span></span>strictly speaking, impossible, since any group may have a
  decided affinity to more than two others. This Classification, beginning (as Birds themselves must
  have begun) with the lower forms, takes us, except in the <i>Oscines</i>, as far as the Families,
  which in most cases are fairly distinguishable, though of very variable value. Coming to Genera,
  and still more to Species, the opinions of authorities often differ so widely, that at present an
  attempt to reconcile them is hopeless. It cannot be denied that Genera and Species are merely
  "convenient bundles," and that divisions of either, if carried too far, defeat the object for
  which Classification is intended. Genera are only more distinct from Species, and Species from
  Races, because the intervening links have disappeared; and, if we could have before us the
  complete series which, according to the doctrine of Evolution, has at some time existed, neither
  Genus nor Species would be capable of definition, any more than are Races in many cases; while the
  same remark will apply to the larger groups.</p>

  <p>From these Races or Geographical variations we may not unnaturally turn to <b>Geographical
  Distribution</b>. It will always be credited to Ornithology that the interesting study of the
  Geographical Distribution of Animals was first placed on a scientific basis as a result of the
  study of Birds. This was effected by Mr. Sclater, whose division of the Globe into Six
  "Regions"&ndash;the <i>Palaearctic</i>, <i>Ethiopian</i>, <i>Indian</i>, and <i>Australian</i>,
  forming one group&ndash;the "Old World" (<i>Palaeogaea</i>); and the <i>Nearctic</i> and
  <i>Neotropical</i>, forming a second&ndash;the "New World" (<i>Neogaea</i>); was announced in 1858
  (<i>J. Linn. Soc.</i> ii. pp. 130-145). His scheme, being solely grounded on Ornithological
  considerations, was accepted with scarcely any modification by Mr. Wallace in his great work
  (<i>Geograph. Distrib. of Animals</i>, 1876), and by the majority of zoologists, though some
  demurred, and among them Huxley, who, in especial reference to Birds, shewed (<i>Proc. Zool.
  Soc.</i> 1868, pp. 313-319) that there was more reason to divide the earth's surface latitudinally
  than longitudinally, and that Four Regions were better than Six&ndash;these four being (1)
  <i>Arctogaea</i>, comprising Mr. Sclater's Indian, Ethiopian, Palaearctic, and Nearctic; (2)
  Austro-Columbia, corresponding with the Neotropical; (3) Australasia; and (4) New
  Zealand&ndash;the last three being combined as <i>Notogaea</i>. In 1882 Prof. Heilprin proposed to
  unite Mr. Sclater's Palaearctic and Nearctic under <span class="pagenum" id="page16"><span
  class="smaller">{16}</span></span>the name of Triarctic; but in the next year (<i>Nature</i>,
  xxvii. p. 606) adopted for that union Prof. Newton's earlier term Holarctic. Some other general
  schemes have been promulgated, as those of M. Trouessart and Professor M&ouml;bius; but they have found
  little support, and with regard to the Class <i>Aves</i>, though certainly not with regard to
  other groups as <i>Pisces</i>, or <i>Mollusca</i>, what is practically the scheme of Mr. Sclater
  has met with acceptance, whether with or without the modifications proposed by Huxley and
  Professor Newton, there being really but two important points of difference&ndash;(1) the
  recognition of New Zealand as a distinct Region, and (2) the union of the Nearctic and Palaearctic
  areas into a single Region. It would be impossible here to set forth the arguments by which these
  views are maintained or contested, and it must suffice to trace briefly the outlines of the
  several districts. <i>New Zealand</i>, if admitted as a distinct Region, consists only of the
  islands so named, the smaller Chatham, Auckland, and Macquarie groups, Antipodes Island, Lord
  Howe's, Norfolk and Kermadec Islands. The <i>Australian</i>, if the preceding be cut off, will
  include Tasmania, all Australia, and the islands to the northward as far as what has been called
  "Wallace's Line" (between Lombok and Bali), Celebes, New Guinea, New Britain, and all the
  countless groups of tropical islands in the Pacific Ocean&ndash;except the Galapagos, which
  undoubtedly belong to the next Region. The <i>Neotropical</i> is made up of all South America, the
  Antilles and Central America, the only doubt being whether to draw the northern boundary so as to
  exclude or include Mexico, or even the southern part of the United States. To this naturally
  succeeds, but with an indefinite southern boundary, the <i>Nearctic</i>, comprising the whole of
  the rest of North America to the shores of the Polar Sea, with the addition of Greenland. Its
  north-western corner, Alaska, is now known to be largely tenanted by forms from Asia, not found
  elsewhere in America, and this is one of the chief reasons assigned for uniting it with the
  <i>Palaearctic</i> area, which may be taken to include Japan and all continental Asia to the north
  of China proper, the Himalayas, the Persian Gulf and the east end of the Mediterranean. Some
  authorities would add Northern Arabia and Lower Egypt; but all have agreed to include Tunis and
  the ancient Mauritania&ndash;the Barbary States lying north of the Great Desert to the Atlantic
  Ocean about Mogador, as well as the Canaries, Madeira and the Azores, with the whole of Europe
  <span class="pagenum" id="page17"><span class="smaller">{17}</span></span>from Greece to Iceland.
  What is left of Arabia and Africa, after taking off the above portions, with the addition of
  Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands, is the <i>Ethiopian</i> Region; and all the rest of
  continental Asia, with the islands not included in the Australian Region, becomes the
  <i>Indian</i>, or, as it has lately been called, the <i>Oriental</i>. It would be quite impossible
  to enumerate here the various Sub-regions and Provinces into which these several Regions may be
  divided. The views of Mr. Wallace are set forth at length in his excellent work, those of Mr.
  Sclater in <i>The Ibis</i> for 1891, pp. 514-557, and those of Professor Newton in his
  <i>Dictionary of Birds</i>. Many writers would assign to Madagascar a higher rank than that of a
  Sub-region.</p>

  <p><b>Migration.</b>&ndash;Few peculiarities of Birds have excited more general interest than
  their seasonal Migration, which in many species is so marked as to have been observed from very
  remote times; and it is probable that nearly all species are subject to periodical movements of
  varying extent. These movements are greatest in the Birds which have their breeding quarters in
  the northern parts of the Northern Hemisphere; and, with some exceptions, it may be said that the
  more northerly is the range of a species the more extensive are its migratory wanderings. In the
  Southern Hemisphere the facts known are as yet insufficient to allow of safe deductions. Absence
  of a food-supply in winter is alone enough to account for migration in the above cases, and the
  return from the south in spring is probably due to the desire of Birds to reoccupy their old
  haunts, or those in which they have been bred. But just as there are some species which habitually
  breed within the Arctic Circle and winter in the Tropics, there are others which may not go so far
  in either direction, and yet have their movements governed by exactly the same principle, with the
  result that in a temperate zone we have Birds coming from the north to winter with us, while
  others, arriving from the south in spring, spend the summer here, and depart towards autumn.
  Others again, the true "Birds of Passage," arriving like the last in spring, make little or no
  stay, but pass onward to more northerly lands, and re-appear for as short a time in autumn on
  their return journey southwards. Moreover, observation shews that, in most parts of the temperate
  zone, there are many Birds which, though <i>resident as species, are migratory as
  individuals</i>&ndash;that is to say, that while examples of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page18"><span class="smaller">{18}</span></span>the species may be met with at certain spots
  throughout the whole year, those which occur at one season are not always the same individuals as
  those which occur at another&ndash;the particular Thrush, Titmouse, or Finch, appearing in the
  winter not being identical with that which appears in summer. Again, among species of which some
  individuals are constantly present throughout the year, a great accession to the numbers is made
  at the close of the breeding-season by the influx of other individuals of the same species bred in
  another district, though this influx generally lasts for a comparatively short time, and the
  strangers pass on, accompanied it may be, by some or even most of those that have been reared on
  the spot in the season immediately preceding. These species are the "Partial Migrants."</p>

  <p>It would at first seem from the above that the annual migratory movement would be in a
  direction due north and south, or south and north, according to season, and so in a general way it
  is; but there is no doubt that this simple movement is disturbed by many causes, chief among which
  is possibly the configuration of the land, which is found to give rise to considerable deviations,
  and that to an extent which is at present very imperfectly understood. It may be considered proved
  that the trend of a coast-line, the course of a great river, or the intervention of a chain of
  mountains, has a very appreciable effect on the direction taken by migrating Birds; but not one of
  these, nor all in combination, affords a sufficient explanation of all the deflexions, and will
  certainly not account for at least one remarkable fact, as it may now be regarded&ndash;the
  tendency of many Birds in Eastern Europe and part of Siberia to travel westward towards the close
  of summer or in autumn. This is shewn in several ways, but in none better than by the almost
  yearly occurrence in Britain at that season of examples of species which breed only in the Russian
  Empire. For, admitting that such examples are stray wanderers, which have lost their course, their
  appearance here is still useful in indicating the existence of the westward movement; and, with
  the evidence they furnish before us, we may judge whence come vast numbers of
  others&ndash;Starlings, Crows, Rooks, Jays, Larks, and what not, whose origin and starting-point
  it would be otherwise hard to trace or even surmise. Much has been written, especially in Europe,
  on so-called Lines of Flight, but as yet to little purpose, and indeed <span class="pagenum"
  id="page19"><span class="smaller">{19}</span></span>scarcely any writers on the subject have had
  sufficient <i>data</i> to form an hypothesis, so that it is not surprising that hardly any two
  agree in theory.<a id="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> In other parts of the world there
  is still less ground for theorising, though in North America many valuable observations have been
  made; and these, in conjunction with those carried on in Europe, will no doubt in due time lead to
  satisfactory results as regards the Northern Hemisphere. Concerning the Southern our ignorance is
  almost complete.</p>

  <p>Of the way in which Migration is performed there is still much to learn&ndash;but one thing is
  certain, all Birds do not migrate in the same manner. Some gather in flocks, great or small,
  others seem to accomplish their northward journey in pairs, or at any-rate arrive at their
  breeding-quarters already paired. Some undoubtedly voyage by night, others may be seen to travel
  by day. Of the Birds which in spring arrive unpaired, it is now incontestable that the males
  outstrip or precede the females. There is, moreover, equal diversity in the southward movements
  towards the close of summer and all through the autumn. Of some species the earlier broods
  disappear without attracting attention, and the later broods as well as the parents slip away
  almost as imperceptibly. In one remarkable case, that of the Cuckoo, the adults leave this country
  long before the young are fit to follow; but, in by far the greater number, the young start first,
  and are followed, often at an interval of some weeks, by their parents.<a id="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> It is contended by many that of actual Migration we see very
  little, since it is constantly carried on at a height where the Birds are beyond our ordinary
  observation, and as regards some species this seems to be true. Moreover, it would seem that the
  longest flights are performed by night, and when the sky is clear, so that only in thick weather
  do the Birds come near enough to the earth to be heard&ndash;seeing them being of course
  impossible in the dark, though in a few cases they have been telescopically observed passing
  across the face of the moon. It is certain that many of the smaller land-birds gradually press
  <span class="pagenum" id="page20"><span class="smaller">{20}</span></span>onwards prior to leaving
  our shores, but after that they may possibly betake themselves aloft to continue their
  journey.</p>

  <p>The speed at which Birds travel during Migration is a matter on which very diverse opinions
  have been and are held; but the highest estimates, such as those of the late Herr G&auml;tke (who would
  allow even 150 miles an hour), can scarcely be otherwise than exaggerations; for there is no
  evidence of any but exceptional performances at such rates, and there is really no reason to
  suppose that Birds can fly faster at a higher elevation than at a lower.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">ARCHAEORNITHES&ndash;NEORNITHES
  RATITAE&ndash;NEORNITHES ODONTOLCAE.</span></p>

  <p>The Class <b>AVES</b> is divided by Dr. Gadow (Bronn's <i>Klassen und Ordnungen des
  Thier-Reichs, Aves, Systemat. Theil</i>, p. 299) into two Sub-classes of like value,
  <i>ARCHAEORNITHES</i> and <i>NEORNITHES</i>, though some writers prefer to consider the former as
  of equal rank only to the several subdivisions of the latter here adopted, namely, <b>Ratitae</b>,
  <b>Odontolcae</b>, and <b>Carinatae</b> (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page25">25</a></span>).
  The question is clearly one of degree, and depends entirely on the amount of weight assigned to
  the various points of distinction to be mentioned below.</p>

  <p>The Sub-class <i>ARCHAEORNITHES</i> is at present represented by but one member, the first
  undoubted fossil Bird, made known in 1861 by Andreas Wagner from the Jurassic slate formation of
  Solenhofen in Bavaria, and now preserved in the British Museum. This he described under the name
  of <i>Griphosaurus</i>; but as Hermann von Meyer had already bestowed the title of
  <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i> upon a bird, presumably identical, a feather of which had been
  obtained from the above system, the latter appellation has a prior claim. In 1877 a second
  example, now at Berlin, was procured from the same beds,<a id="NtA_12"
  href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> since which date Meyer's specific name has become firmly
  established, in place of that of <i>macrura</i> given by Owen to Wagner's specimen.</p>

  <p>This very remarkable animal, about the size of a Rook, is without doubt a connecting link
  between Reptiles and Birds; but zoologists are practically unanimous in regarding it as an Avine
  form, with Reptilian affinities and probably arboreal habits.</p>

  <p>The sternum was possibly furnished with a weak keel, the strong wide furcula was <span
  class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the ribs had no uncinate processes, while in all probability the
  coracoid and scapula made a right, or even an acute, angle at their junction, and the centra of
  the vertebrae of the neck and back were biconcave. The bill was short and blunt, each side of the
  upper jaw possessing about thirteen teeth, of which six seem to have belonged to the praemaxilla;
  whereas in each side of the lower jaw only three can be recognised, and those towards the anterior
  extremity. These teeth, conical in shape and of fairly equal size, were fixed in a regular row, in
  distinct sockets. The fibula and tibia did not coalesce, the latter exceeding the metatarsus in
  length; the toes were four <span class="pagenum" id="page25"><span
  class="smaller">{25}</span></span>in number, with two, three, four, and five phalanges
  respectively, ending in claws, the hallux being directed backwards. The manus had three free
  digits, and apparently three free metacarpals; the pollex consisted of two joints, the index of
  three and the third finger of four, while each had a strong hooked claw at the tip. The hand was
  furnished with six or seven well-developed primaries, attached to the third metacarpal and the
  second and third digits, the number of secondaries being ten. The long Lizard-like tail had no
  terminal pygostyle, but was composed of about twenty-one free post-sacral vertebrae, of which the
  first twelve each bore a pair of large feathers, similar to those of the wing, with the inner webs
  broader than the outer, and with decided shafts.<a id="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Sub-class <i>NEORNITHES</i> may be arranged, as above stated, in three divisions, (A)
  <b>Neornithes Ratitae</b>, (B) <b>Neornithes Odontolcae</b>, and (C) <b>Neornithes Carinatae</b>.
  The first of these contains the Ratite Birds proper and possibly part of the so-called <i><span
  class="sc">Stereornithes</span></i> of Patagonia (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page43">43</a></span>), with several fossil forms of doubtful position from England,
  France, and New Mexico, as will be seen below; the second the <i><span
  class="sc">Hesperornithes</span></i> of the Cretaceous Shales of Kansas, the <i><span
  class="sc">Enaliornithes</span></i> of the Cambridge Upper Greensand, and <i>Baptornis</i> of the
  American Chalk; the third the <i><span class="sc">Ichthyornithes</span></i> of the aforesaid
  Kansas deposits, and all other existing Birds, with various extinct species closely allied to
  them.</p>

  <p>Of the points of distinction between the Neornithes and the Archaeornithes the most important
  are that the metacarpals are fused together, the second digit being the longest, and the third
  more or less reduced; and that the number of caudal vertebrae does not, as far as is known, exceed
  thirteen, of which the last five or six combine together to form a pygostyle, except in the
  Hesperornithes, Ratitae, and Tinamidae, where such is seldom the case.<a id="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The <i>centra</i> of the vertebrae also are concave on one side
  only, except in <i>Ichthyornis</i>, and perhaps in <i>Enaliornis</i>. The possession of teeth is,
  of course, exceptional, as is the remarkable loss of the keel of the sternum in the Ratitae.</p>

  <p>It is now generally, if not universally, agreed that Flightless Birds were developed from those
  that could fly. It does not, however, necessarily follow that the Neornithes are direct <span
  class="pagenum" id="page26"><span class="smaller">{26}</span></span>descendants of the
  Archaeornithes, as each may be a separate offshoot from the same parent stem. All we can safely
  assert is, that the former were in existence about the end of the Jurassic times, that teeth were
  still retained in some cases during the Cretaceous Epoch, and that not only normal forms, but also
  flightless forms without keel or pygostyle,<a id="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> had
  arisen by that date.</p>

  <p>(A) The <b>Ratitae</b> are commonly characterised as Birds with no keel to the sternum; but
  this will not hold as a definition, since <i>Hesperornis</i> has also that peculiarity, while such
  genera as <i>Didus</i>, <i>Stringops</i>, <i>Cnemiornis</i>, and <i>Notornis</i> are nearly in the
  same condition. It is no one point, therefore, but the sum of many, which enables us to draw so
  clear a line of demarcation between this primitive group and the remainder of existing forms;
  nevertheless it is convenient to preserve the name unaltered, as it is well understood to what
  members of the class it is more especially meant to apply. The rhamphotheca, or horny sheath of
  the bill, instead of being simple, is composed of several more or less separate pieces, as in the
  Procellariidae, Tinamidae, and Steganopodes; the quadrate bone, by means of which the lower jaw is
  articulated to the skull, in place of two proximal knobs has only one, as in <i>Hesperornis</i>,
  <i>Ichthyornis</i>, and the Tinamidae; the coracoid and scapula are fused together, and meet at an
  obtuse, as opposed to an acute or right, angle; and the last six or seven caudal vertebrae do not
  coalesce into a pygostyle, or upright triangular expansion to carry the rectrices, a state of
  things found elsewhere in <i>Hesperornis</i> and the Tinamidae.<a id="NtA_16"
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> The reduced wings preclude flight; the tail is functionless, as
  in the Podicipedidae and Tinamidae; the tongue is very small; the oil gland is absent; the penis
  is large and erectile, being comparable to that of the Anseriformes; while in the adult the
  feathers are evenly distributed over the whole surface, as in the Spheniscidae and Palamedeidae,
  no down being present. Claws are found on the pollex and index in <i>Struthio</i> and <i>Rhea</i>,
  or occasionally on the third digit; in <i>Casuarius</i>, <i>Dromaeus</i>, and <i>Apteryx</i> they
  occur only on the index.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Ratite Birds proper are comprised in six groups, <span
  class="sc">Struthiones</span> or Ostriches, <span class="sc">Rheae</span> or Nandus, <span
  class="sc">Megistanes</span> or Cassowaries and Emeus, <span class="sc">Apteryges</span> or Kiwis,
  <span class="sc">Dinornithes</span> or Moas, and <span class="sc">Aepyornithes</span> or Rocs.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page27"><span class="smaller">{27}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>I. STRUTHIONES.</b></p>

  <p>Fam. <b>Struthionidae</b>.&ndash;These birds are distinguished from all others by having only
  two toes&ndash;the third and fourth&ndash;the terminal phalanges of which are shortened and bear
  thick stunted claws, that of the outer toe being commonly absent. The whole foot, including the
  long scutellated metatarsus, is exceptionally stout, and the toes are padded beneath. The beak is
  short, broad, and depressed, with deeply split gape; the head is small, with large eyes; the neck
  very long; the wing- and drooping tail-feathers&ndash;the plumes of commerce&ndash;are large and
  soft, with broad equal vanes. The furcula and syringeal muscles are wanting, nor is there any
  aftershaft.</p>

  <p><i>Struthio camelus</i>, the Ostrich or "Camel-bird" of North Africa, now extends from Barbary
  to Arabia, and even to Mesopotamia, though no longer found, as of old, in Egypt or Central Asia,
  its former occurrence in Baluchistan being somewhat open to question. It is black with white wings
  and tail, having a flesh-coloured neck covered with brownish down, and partially bare tibiae of
  the same hue. The female and young male are almost entirely cinereous, while the chicks are
  clothed with bristly yellowish-white down with blackish stripes. The eggs of the typical northern
  bird have a surface like ivory, while those from Southern Africa are marked with close-set pits,
  whence some authorities recognise a different species (<i>S. australis</i>) in the latter region,
  distinguishable, moreover, by the bluish colour of the naked parts. Examples from Somaliland and
  the adjoining districts of East Africa to Lake Tanganyika are separated as <i>S.
  molybdophanes</i>, on account of the leaden colour of the unfeathered portions, coupled with a red
  patch on the front of the metatarsus. The eggs are smoother than in the southern species, but
  similarly pitted. The fossil forms <i>S. asiaticus</i> from the Pliocene of the Siwalik Hills of
  India, and <i>S. karatheodori</i> from the Upper Miocene of Samos complete the family, while
  <i>S.</i> (<i>Struthiolithus</i>) <i>chersonensis</i> has been founded on a petrified egg from the

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Ostrich stands about eight feet high, being the largest of existing birds; it frequents
  sandy wastes and dry arid localities, such as are found in the Sahara and the plains and valleys
  of Southern Africa, while districts studded with low bushes are not unfrequently tenanted. Though
  the fable of the head being hidden to avoid detection is of course devoid of foundation, this
  species is timid and wild in its native haunts, and being keen-sighted as well as wary, gives an
  impression of great restlessness. From the fact that a single stride is said to cover twenty-five
  feet or more, it will readily be understood that the speed is very great, exceeding that of a
  galloping horse; but, owing to its habit of running in a curve, it is generally possible to
  intercept the bird's path at a distance from the point where it started. In motion the head is
  held forward, and the wings are outspread, while both beak and feet are used as weapons of defence
  when capture is imminent, the latter delivering strong sideways kicks, which make close quarters
  very dangerous. Forty or fifty individuals may at times be seen in company; the usual parties,
  however, consist of five or six at most, especially during the breeding season, when the
  polygamous cock escorts a flock of several hens, obtained by battle or allured by courting
  performances earlier in the season. A liking for the companionship of zebras, hartebeests and
  other antelopes, has been noticed by various observers. The cry is said to be hoarse and mournful,
  resembling the roar of a lion or <span class="pagenum" id="page29"><span
  class="smaller">{29}</span></span>the lowing of an ox; but Ostriches are, as a rule, decidedly
  silent. In a state of nature the food consists chiefly of herbage, including seeds and fruits; in
  captivity the diet is of every description, and even in a wild condition small mammals, birds,
  reptiles, and insects are eaten, with a quantity of grit to aid digestion. In confinement the
  birds become very tame, and will then swallow bones, nails, and the like&ndash;in fact almost
  anything they can pick up. They can exist for a long time without water, but drink regularly when
  opportunity offers; they show a liking for salt, and will bathe in the sea or in rivers, immersed
  up to the neck. The hens belonging to one cock lay in the same nest, which is a fairly shallow
  excavation dug in sand or dry soil, and surrounded by the material thrown out during the process,
  or more rarely by an edging of grass. The spot is hard to discover in the desert, the stride being
  too long for tracks to be of much assistance. More than thirty yellowish-white eggs are sometimes
  deposited within the pit in circular arrangement, and many more are dropped around, to serve, it
  is asserted, for food for the newly-hatched young; in the wild state, however, the average number
  is probably less. The contents, equal to those of some two dozen hens' eggs, are used for food by
  the natives, the shells forming convenient pots for water and so forth. The cock undertakes almost
  the whole duty of incubation, being occasionally relieved by the hens during the daytime;<a
  id="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> but when the sun is hot no brooding is necessary,
  though a covering of sand is superposed to guard the spot from the depredations of marauders. The
  chicks, which run from the shell, are hatched in six or seven weeks, and are accompanied by both
  parents, the male often counterfeiting wounds to draw away the intruder, circling around with
  drooping wings or throwing himself down as if in extremities.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Ostriches were well known to the ancients, who used the plumes for ornament, as we
  do; these were considered emblems of justice from the equality of the two webs, or were worn in
  token of victory, as is still done in some parts of Africa. The words of Aristotle&ndash;who was
  followed by Pliny in the statement that the Ostrich was part quadruped, part bird&ndash;combine
  with those of Xenophon to bear witness to this knowledge, while monuments, inscriptions, and even
  the Bible tell the same tale. In the Sahara and elsewhere these birds are hunted with horses and
  camels, <span class="pagenum" id="page30"><span class="smaller">{30}</span></span>being stalked or
  ridden down by means of fresh relays of beasts; the Namaquas draw a cordon round them; the
  Bushman, concealed in sand or disguised in skins, shoots them with poisoned arrows; while the
  lasso, pitfall, or other device are used in particular districts. Space will not permit a detailed
  account of the Ostrich farms of modern Africa, so well described in Messrs. de Mosenthal and
  Harting's <i>Ostriches and Ostrich-Farming</i>, and other books; but it may be mentioned that the
  tribes of the north of that continent have long been in the habit of domesticating the bird, that
  the value of the sales in South Africa is not far from a million pounds yearly, and that the
  plumes are plucked or, preferably, cut about twice a year, the adults yielding the finest
  feathers. The flesh is coarse, and of little use for food.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>II. RHEAE.</b></p>

  <p>Fam. <b>Rheidae</b>.&ndash;The Rheas, or Nandus, have the head, neck, and bill much like those
  of Ostriches, the maxilla being somewhat more rounded and terminating in a nail-like process; the
  metatarsus is also similar and equally stout in proportion, but the toes are three in number in
  place of two, the mid-phalanges being shortened and the terminal furnished with decided claws. In
  <i>Rhea darwini</i> alone the metatarsi are mainly reticulated instead of scutellated anteriorly,
  and have the upper portion feathered. The bones of the wing are comparatively well developed, the
  feathers being slender but not ornamental, while there is no apparent tail. The furcula is
  wanting, as is the aftershaft to the feathers, but the syrinx is tracheo-bronchial with one pair
  of syringeal muscles, a condition absolutely unique among the Ratitae. The head and neck are
  feathered, only the lores, orbits, and ear-openings being naked, and of these the latter are
  surrounded by bristles.</p>

  <p><i>Rhea americana</i>, the so-called American Ostrich, the Ema of the Brazilians, the Avestruz,
  Nand&uacute;, or Chuek&eacute; of Argentina, is found from Bolivia, Paraguay, and South Brazil to the Rio Negro,
  if not further; it is brownish-grey with blackish crown, nape, and breast, white thighs and
  abdomen, and yellowish neck. The sub-species <i>R. macrorhyncha</i> of North-East Brazil is
  darker, with longer bill and more slender metatarsi. <i>R. darwini</i>, which occurs south of the
  Rio Negro, and up the Andes to Tarapaca, is buffish-brown, with whiter underparts and white
  margins to the <span class="pagenum" id="page31"><span class="smaller">{31}</span></span>feathers
  of the wings and back. Hens are not so dark, and Mr. Hudson says<a id="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> that in <i>R. darwini</i> the young are dusky grey and are
  hatched with the legs feathered to the toes. Rheas are shorter than Ostriches by about a couple of
  feet, <i>R. americana</i> being the largest form; the feathers are much rounded, broad, and very
  soft. Fossil remains occur in the Upper Tertiary or quite recent deposits of South America.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The members of this family find their favourite haunts on the treeless flats of the
  Argentine pampas, the scrub-covered plains of Patagonia, or the dry open Sert&otilde;es of Brazil, where
  their acute vision enables them to detect the approach of enemies from afar. Small flocks of from
  three to seven individuals are met with at certain seasons, and parties of twenty or thirty at
  other times&ndash;often with deer or guanacos&ndash;so it would appear that, as in the case of the
  Ostrich, larger companies are formed after the young are able to provide for themselves. The birds
  become exceedingly tame when not molested, but when danger threatens they run at great speed,
  doubling upon their pursuers constantly, or crouching down among bushes or other cover, if they
  think they can escape observation. In the latter case they will lie closely until almost trodden
  upon, and may be shot before they rise by the hunter who cautiously approaches their hiding-place,
  as the head is usually visible above the surrounding vegetation. When moving at full pace the
  wings have normally a somewhat drooping position, but they are raised alternately above the
  back&ndash;apparently <span class="pagenum" id="page32"><span class="smaller">{32}</span></span>to
  aid progress&ndash;when fresh exertions are necessary. Mr. Hudson tells us<a id="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> that Darwin's Rhea "carries its neck stretched forward, which
  makes it seem lower in stature than the allied species." The diet consists chiefly of grass,
  roots, and seeds, but berries of <i>Empetrum</i> are a favourite food, and lizards, insects,
  worms, and molluscs are said to be eaten, together with hard substances to promote digestion.
  Nandus take readily to the water, and can swim across a river several hundred yards wide, the body
  being hardly visible. In spring the cock utters a deep, resonant, booming noise, a loud hiss being
  not uncommonly heard also; while at that season the rival males attack each other viciously with
  their beaks, trampling down the ground in their passion, but not generally using their feet, as
  they do when wounded. The hens secured by each of the cocks lay together in a mere depression in
  the soil with very little, if any, lining; the eggs numbering from twenty to thirty, or
  exceptionally more, besides those scattered about outside the nest. Here again Mr. Hudson is our
  authority for stating<a id="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> that the eggs of <i>R.
  americana</i> are golden yellow when fresh, those of <i>R. darwini</i> deep rich green; both
  however fade quickly to a whitish colour. The male incubates very closely for about six weeks,
  often taking up his position, as the Ostrich does, before the final egg is laid; he afterwards
  attends upon the young, and charges intruders who seem dangerous, with outstretched wings and
  beak. Rheas may be captured by riding after them in a semicircle, which closes upon them as they
  go, or by means of long-winded hounds; but the most usual method is that of hurling the "bolas" or
  leaden balls connected by leather thongs, which wind around the bird's neck or legs, and thereby
  hamper its movements or throw it down. The feathers, though inferior to Ostrich plumes, are much
  used for brooms and the like, and are said to be called "Vautour" in the trade. The flesh is very
  poor. These birds have bred both on the Continent and in Britain.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>III. MEGISTANES.</b></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Megistanes</span> comprise the <i>Casuariidae</i> or Cassowaries, and the
  <i>Dromaeidae</i> or Emeus, the following being the chief peculiarities of the group. The wings
  are quite rudimentary; <span class="pagenum" id="page33"><span
  class="smaller">{33}</span></span>the aftershaft of the contour feathers is extremely large, so
  that they appear to be double; three front toes are present, with shortened mid-phalanges and
  large claws; and the two clavicles do not meet. The lack of ornamental wing- or tail-plumes, and
  the hair-like nature of the coat is also characteristic, while, as opposed to <i>Rhea</i>, there
  is no indication of syringeal muscles. Within the group itself the Cassowaries are distinguished
  from the Emeus by the points next to be mentioned. The former have a compressed keeled beak and a
  large casque of bony tissue upon the bare head, the greater part of the neck being also naked and
  in most cases wattled; the remiges are reduced to thick black barbless quills from four to six in
  number, and the inner toe has a particularly long sharp claw. Emeus, on the contrary, have a broad
  depressed beak, short feathers on the head and neck, no helmet, wattles, or spines on the wing,
  and an ordinary claw on the inner toe. Both Families have long necks, stout metatarsi covered with
  coarse roundish scales, and toes padded below; the tibia being nearly, if not quite, covered by
  the plumage.</p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Casuariidae.</b>&ndash;Following Professor Salvadori,<a id="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Cassowaries may be divided into two groups: the first with the
  helmet laterally compressed, and the second where it is triangular and pyramidal, or even
  depressed. They are all large birds, though smaller than Emeus, which are only surpassed in size
  among existing forms by the Ostrich; the colour of the coarse but glossy hair-like plumage is
  black, and similar in both sexes; the hen is bigger than the cock, as is also the case in the
  Dromaeidae and Apterygidae.</p>

  <p>Of the first of the above groups, <i>Casuarius tricarunculatus</i>, from Warbusi in New Guinea,
  which is possibly a "sport," has two lateral wattles on the fore-neck and a third small median
  caruncle at a lower level. <i>C. bicarunculatus</i>, of the Aru Islands, has two long distant
  reddish-violet wattles, a black casque, bluish-green head, and blue neck with some red behind.
  <i>C. galeatus</i> of Ceram, the species first known to ornithologists, is similarly coloured,
  though less brightly, and has the flesh-coloured throat-wattles close together, and a naked
  reddish-purple space on each side of the neck. The larger <i>C. australis</i> of North-East
  Australia has a higher helmet, a brighter blue throat, and a few scattered hairs on the wattles,
  which Wall, who discovered the species, said were coloured with blue and scarlet. <i>C.
  beccarii</i> of the Aru Islands, <span class="pagenum" id="page34"><span
  class="smaller">{34}</span></span>Middle and South New Guinea, has the front and top of the casque
  black, its sides greenish, and its back yellowish; the head is grey-blue, the throat and sides of
  the neck are blue, the hind-neck is red and orange, a yellow streak running across to the
  mandible; a bare space on each side of the base of the neck is flesh-coloured, and the long single
  neck-wattle of the same colour is somewhat deeply divided at the tip.</p>

  <p>Of the second group, <i>C. uniappendiculatus</i> (Fig. 10), of Salawatti and the adjoining
  parts of New Guinea, has the head, throat, and nape blue, the lower portion of the neck and the
  median pear-shaped caruncle yellow, the casque dusky olive, and a longitudinal naked space towards
  the sides of the neck flesh-coloured with a yellow margin. <i>C. occipitalis</i> of Jobi Island is
  distinguished from the last-named by a large occipital spot of yellow and a paler helmet; while
  the remaining three forms have no wattle at all. Of these, <i>C. papuanus</i>, of North-East New
  Guinea, has a dusky black casque, blue head, throat, and fore-neck, grey-green occiput and
  auricular region, and orange hind-neck changing into rosy flesh-colour towards the sides. <i>C.
  picticollis</i> of South-East New Guinea has a black helmet, grey-blue occiput, violet-blue nape,
  pale blue hind-neck, red throat and longitudinal space on the sides of the lower neck; <i>C.
  bennetti</i> of New Britain differing in having the head and neck of an almost uniform blue.
  Nestling Cassowaries are clothed in rusty brown, relieved by darker stripes; at a later period
  they become more tawny, and the black plumage begins to appear; but a few hair-like feathers
  remain on the head for some time, while the helmet is very gradually developed from a flat
  Coot-like shield, though the gaudy colours of the neck and wattles are assumed much earlier.<a
  id="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

  <p>All the species of this family inhabit wooded country, commonly of the densest description,
  though often found in more open scrub and in the neighbourhood of creeks and watercourses.
  Naturally shy but inquisitive, they have been rendered doubly wary by man's persecution since
  their haunts have been invaded by colonists. They dislike the sun, and emerge from cover only in
  the morning and evening, seeking their favourite spots, where they feed chiefly on fallen fruit,
  varying this diet with insects and crustaceans. Berries, leaf-buds, and bulbs are, however, also
  eaten, with grit and pebbles for digestive purposes, and in captivity they are almost
  omnivorous.</p>

  <p>In this state they become extremely tame, and are kept like fowls by the natives of some
  districts, who consider the flesh very palatable; while in Queensland the adults are said to be
  hunted with dogs. The plumage is used for the manufacture of mats, rugs, head-ornaments, and the
  like. Cassowaries run with wonderful swiftness, though rather heavily, diving into the bushes at a
  moment's notice, or aiding themselves by their wings, and leaping over obstacles as much as six
  feet high, if shelter is not readily available. They usually rest on the whole of the metatarsus,
  but sleep on the breast, or perhaps occasionally on the side; at other times they will dance about
  with contortions of the neck, or roll on the ground like playful monkeys. Old males become very
  fierce when driven to bay, kicking out in front or sideways, ruffling up their feathers and using
  their beaks at the same time. In the wet season swimming is a common practice, wide rivers being
  <span class="pagenum" id="page36"><span class="smaller">{36}</span></span>crossed with ease, and
  in the absence of other bathing-places the sea is often utilised. The note in a state of
  excitement is a sort of grunt or snort, the call to the young being of a lowing nature; but the
  ordinary voice is loud, guttural, and unearthly, consisting of quickly-repeated croaking sounds,
  lasting for as long as three minutes, and audible at a distance of a mile, or considerably more.
  The female is much quieter, while the "Mooruk" (<i>C. bennetti</i>) is stated to utter a low
  scolding or plaintive whistle. A rough nest of leaves and grass is formed in a depression of the
  soil, generally below bushes or tangled undergrowth, in which from three to six very large eggs
  are deposited, placed in the shape of the letter <span class="sans fwb">V</span>. These are
  normally light green in ground colour, with close-set granulations of dark bright green; but one,
  if not more, is ordinarily of a perfectly smooth texture, and is therefore entirely light green.
  The cock incubates, it appears, solely, though some say that the hen takes her turn; and the
  former tends the young when hatched, the period of sitting being about seven weeks. The nest is
  said to be covered by the parent if left for a time, but this is uncertain, as is the use of the
  two or three eggs scattered round the nest, which are asserted by natives of widely-distant
  districts to furnish food for the chicks. After breeding, small flocks are formed in some cases,
  possibly by the combination of two families. The Ceram species, which seems to have been called
  "Emeu" or "Ema" by the early Portuguese navigators, often lays in captivity, while <i>C.
  bennetti</i> has bred in the gardens of the Zoological Society of London.</p>

  <p>Fossil remains occur in Australia. <i>Hypselornis sivalensis</i> is an allied form from the
  Pliocene of the Siwalik Hills in India.</p>

  <p>Fam. II. <b>Dromaeidae.</b>&ndash;From about the beginning of this century the name "Emeu,"
  used, as mentioned above, in varying form for both the Rhea and the Cassowary, has been restricted
  to the genus <i>Dromaeus</i>, the members of which stand more than five feet high, though lower on
  their legs than an Ostrich. <i>D. novae-hollandiae</i> of the interior of Eastern Australia, which
  extended in times past to Tasmania and the islands in Bass's Straits, is blackish grey, with black
  tips to the plumage. <i>D. irroratus</i>, a more slender species from West, and probably the
  adjoining parts of South, Australia, has each feather transversely barred with dark grey and
  white, and a rufous margin to the black patch at the end. Young birds in down are greyish-white,
  with longitudinal blackish streaks above, <span class="pagenum" id="page37"><span
  class="smaller">{37}</span></span>and spots on the head and lower parts. The sexes are similarly
  coloured, both possessing a remarkable tracheal pouch, connected by a slit with the windpipe, and
  only fully developed in adults.<a id="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In their general habits Emeus are not unlike Cassowaries, but they inhabit sandy plains or open
  forest districts, being invariably monogamous, though seen in small parties after breeding. Their
  sight is keen, they run strongly and rapidly, rest on the whole metatarsus, and kick out backwards
  towards the side. The food is of fruit, roots, and herbage, generally obtained in the morning or
  evening; water is freely drunk, and the birds love bathing, being capable of crossing even a broad
  river. They utter at times a hissing or grunting sound, but in the nesting season a peculiar loud
  booming or drumming note is produced, probably in connexion with the tracheal pouch. The nest may
  be a mere hollow scraped in the ground, with or without a surrounding ring of grass or
  plant-stems, or a mound of bark-scales some three inches high<a id="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>; the eggs are from seven to thirteen in number, or even more,
  and are of a dark, or occasionally light, <span class="pagenum" id="page38"><span
  class="smaller">{38}</span></span>green colour, while the surface is covered with granulations
  which give it the appearance of shagreen. They are small for the size of the bird, being less than
  those of the Cassowary. The cock performs the duties of incubation, and it is very doubtful
  whether the hen ever assists him; the chicks break the shell in about eight weeks. The flesh is
  moderately good for eating, and the fat below the skin yields a large quantity of oil. The birds
  are constantly hunted with dogs or shot on account of the damage they do to wire fencing and the
  grass they devour. Emeus are easily domesticated, and propagate readily in semi-confinement, being
  perfectly hardy in Britain and elsewhere.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>D. patricius</i> is a fossil species from the Pleistocene of Queensland and New

  <p class="ac"><b>IV. APTERYGES.</b></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Apteryges</span>, or Kiwis, have been recently shown to be much more
  nearly related to the Dinornithes than to the remaining Ratite forms, and are accordingly placed
  in close proximity to them in the classification here adopted. Professor T. J. Parker has,
  moreover, lately formulated a new system&ndash;excluding the <i>Aepyornithes</i>, which may
  commend itself to many persons as a further improvement.<a id="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> In this, the Order <i>Struthiones</i> contains the family
  Struthionidae, and the <i>Rheae</i> the Rheidae; but the third Order, upon which the name
  <i>Megistanes</i>, Vieillot, is bestowed, includes two Sub-Orders&ndash;<i>Casuariformes</i>,
  comprising the Casuariidae and Dromaeidae, and <i>Apterygiformes</i>, with the Dinornithidae and
  Apterygidae. In other words, the original stock is considered to have produced three Ratite
  branches only, the third of which gives rise to two twigs, each of these separating again into two
  smaller twigs representing the Families.</p>

  <p>Fam. <b>Apterygidae</b>.&ndash;These birds are at once distinguished <span class="pagenum"
  id="page39"><span class="smaller">{39}</span></span>from all their allies by their small size, and
  by the long, weak, decurved bill, which tapers regularly and has the nostrils placed almost at the
  extremity. The head and eyes are comparatively small, as will be seen to be the case in the
  Dinornithidae. The legs are very stout and situated backwardly, a small elevated hallux is
  present, and the toes are provided with long, sharp claws. The moderate metatarsus is reticulated
  in the young, but is clothed with fairly large scutes in the adult, when it becomes much smoother.
  The wings are small-boned and invisible, with functionless quills, the tail is rudimentary, the
  aftershaft and furcula are absent, while many elongated hairs occur on the front of the head.</p>

  <p>These curious flightless birds are confined to New Zealand, whence a specimen was brought to
  England as early as 1813. <i>Apteryx mantelli</i>, of the North Island, is deep red-brown with
  longitudinal streaks of yellowish-brown, the head being darker and the lower parts greyer; <i>A.
  australis</i>, of the South Island, is lighter, and feels soft instead of harsh when grasped.
  <i>A. oweni</i>, of both islands, is much smaller, and is light grey-brown, transversely marked
  with blackish bars. <i>A. haasti</i>, also said to occur in both islands,<a id="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> is a larger and darker form of the last named; <i>A. lawryi</i>,
  of Stewart Island, hardly differs from <i>A. australis</i>; while <i>A. maximus</i>, of Verreaux,
  is a very doubtful species. Mr. Rothschild<a id="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> has
  founded a sub-species (<i>occidentalis</i>) <span class="pagenum" id="page40"><span
  class="smaller">{40}</span></span>on examples of <i>A. oweni</i> from the North Island and the
  west of the South Island. In all these birds the lanceolate feathers have a hair-like texture, due
  to the disunited filaments of the upper portion, the lower part being covered with grey down, and
  the rhachis more or less exserted. The tibia is feathered, the bill being yellowish, and the feet
  brown or black. The female is similar, but larger, the young blacker. Mr. Lydekker has described a
  fossil species, <i>Pseudapteryx gracilis</i>, from New Zealand,<a id="NtA_30"

  <p class="sp3">Kiwis inhabit wooded country and hills up to the snow line; they are still met with
  at low elevations on a few islands, but their retreats are now chiefly on the slopes and in the
  gullies of the mountains, where a dense undergrowth of shrubs and tree-ferns shades a carpet of
  creeping vegetation and moss. Here parties of from six to twelve used to be seen, though in the
  breeding season they separated into pairs, but at the present day flocks can hardly be hoped for.
  In the daytime these shy birds hide in burrows in the ground, or natural cavities under tree-roots
  or rocks, while towards dusk they emerge in an animated condition. The direct rays of the sun seem
  to dazzle them, and they roll themselves up into a ball, if not disturbed; when stirred up they
  are somewhat sleepy and quickly retreat to cover. Lengthy strides carry them along at a great
  pace, the body being held obliquely with outstretched neck; and, if molested, they ruffle up the
  plumage and snap the bill, while striking viciously with their feet at the intruder, the leg being
  drawn up to the breast and the blow delivered downwards. Sometimes they rest upright with the
  point of the bill touching the ground, sometimes upon the whole metatarsus, but usually they are
  seen at feeding time cautiously moving from spot to spot, and tapping the soil or the walls of
  their cage with their long sensitive beaks. A sniffing sound accompanies this operation, and
  probably the smell of food assists in its discovery, yet the sense of touch is no doubt the
  primary agent. The diet consists chiefly of worms, in search of which the ground is deeply probed,
  and shows funnel-like holes scattered over its surface; when a capture is made the worm is
  extricated with a gentle wriggling motion, and is either beaten upon the ground to kill it, or
  swallowed at once with a jerk of <span class="pagenum" id="page41"><span
  class="smaller">{41}</span></span>the head. Grubs, beetles, molluscs, and berries are also eaten,
  with grit or pebbles as digestives. The loud whistling note, which gives the name to the Kiwi, is
  chiefly heard on light nights, that of the female being shorter, and the young uttering a
  chuckling or kitten-like cry. Growls are emitted by the birds when disturbed, and they have a
  curious way of yawning in the daytime. The nest is usually in an enlarged space at the end of a
  round tunnel in the soft earth, said to be made by the female alone, the opening being under a
  tree-root, a stone, or a tussock of grass; it consists merely of a little dry fern, herbage, or a
  few leaves. The eggs&ndash;generally two in number, though one is often found, and three are
  recorded&ndash;are enormous for the size of the bird, and are equal to a quarter of its weight;
  they are pure white, or slightly green in hue, with a smooth surface, recalling by their
  appearance those of the Whooper. The Maories are very fond of the flesh, either roasted or boiled,
  and hunt Kiwis systematically with muzzled dogs, while of old the chiefs utilised the plumage for
  ornamentation. The cock performs most, if not all, of the duties of incubation, and attends upon
  the young. Females lay in captivity, but no chicks appear to have been hatched as yet under these
  conditions.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>V. DINORNITHES.</b></p>

  <p>The Family <b>Dinornithidae</b> contains those well-known extinct New Zealand forms the Moas,
  as they are supposed to have been denominated by the Maories, some of which were of gigantic size.
  The larger species must have been comparatively rare, judging by the fossils obtained, while some
  seem to have survived until about four or five hundred years ago, or even a century later in the
  South Island. Being flightless, these birds were easily slaughtered by the natives, who were very
  fond of the flesh, and captured them when exhausted by repeated spear-wounds, after they had been
  driven from their retreats by burning the grass and vegetation. It was not until the year 1839
  that a femur-shaft was exhibited by Owen to the Zoological Society of London, that being the first
  portion of a Moa known to have reached this country; but since the above date an immense quantity
  of bones of all descriptions have been procured in many parts of both the North and the South
  Islands, some hidden under the sand or exposed upon <span class="pagenum" id="page42"><span
  class="smaller">{42}</span></span>its surface, some in marshes and superficial deposits generally,
  and others in caves, hollows of rocks, or cooking places of the former inhabitants. Footprints
  have been observed in the sandstone; portions of muscles, ligaments, and even of skin have been
  discovered; and, most remarkable of all, feathers have been met with of fresh appearance and
  unfaded colours. Pebbles used to aid digestion, and eggs, both whole and fragmentary, complete the
  list.</p>

  <p>Moas had comparatively small heads, and also small orbits and eyes; the bill varied, as will be
  seen below; the legs were stout, though not always equally so, a hallux being usually present; the
  wings were extremely reduced, or even wanting; the furcula was absent, and the aftershaft of the
  larger feathers was of great size. The neck is supposed to have been partially bare, while the
  webs of the rounded feathers were disunited and more or less downy below. Some of the latter were
  black, with red-brown bases and white tips, others were blackish-brown or yellowish.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Professor Parker, in his recent memoir,<a id="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> proposes three Sub-families, <i>Dinornithinae</i>,
  <i>Anomalopteryginae</i>, and <i>Emeinae</i>; <i>Megalapteryx</i>, which he omits, possibly
  representing a fourth. The first of these contains only one genus, <i>Dinornis</i>, with wide
  convex sternum, comparatively slender limbs, broad skull, and long, wide, deflected beak; the
  height of <i>D. maximus</i>, the largest of the whole group, being estimated at about twelve feet.
  The second Sub-family comprises three genera, <i>Pachyornis</i>, <i>Mesopteryx</i>, and
  <i>Anomalopteryx</i>, forms of small or moderate height and varying bulk, with less broad skulls
  and pointed beaks, the sternum ranging from long and narrow to wide and flat. The third possesses
  a single genus, <i>Emeus</i>, in which the limbs are heavy, the strongly-built skull is narrow,
  and the beak short and broad. <i>Pachyornis elephantopus</i> has extraordinarily stout, short
  legs, while <i>Anomalopteryx parva</i>, perhaps the smallest Moa known, is said to have been about
  the size of a turkey. The validity of some genera and species is, however, questionable. Most
  writers think that the female was larger than the male. Mr. De Vis has described a fossil femur
  from Queensland as <i>D. queenslandiae</i>,<a id="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> but it
  may belong to the Dromaeidae. According to native testimony the habits were sluggish, but the
  birds were dangerous to approach; they lived in pairs and fed upon green shoots and roots of
  ferns, making a nest of a pile <span class="pagenum" id="page43"><span
  class="smaller">{43}</span></span>of grass and leaves. We are told that the eggs found with the
  remains were dark green, light green, or yellowish, but the last colour at least probably refers
  to faded specimens.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>VI. AEPYORNITHES.</b></p>

  <p>Quite as remarkable as the Moas are the immense, massive-limbed forms of the Family
  <b>Aepyornithidae</b>, supposed by many to be identical with the "Ruc" or "Roc" of the Venetian
  traveller Marco Polo, and of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. If this is the case, the size of the birds
  and their eggs must have been absurdly exaggerated, since the largest species known probably stood
  about seven feet high, and the egg is certainly not as big as a butt; nevertheless, the fact of
  the Roc being accredited to Madagascar makes it probable enough that the fables were engrafted
  upon <i>Aepyornis</i>, which was an inhabitant of that island. The eggs were first brought to the
  notice of ornithologists by Strickland in 1849, while soon afterwards Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire
  obtained two of them, with some fragments of bones.<a id="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> These eggs, which exceed all others in magnitude, measuring some
  thirteen inches by nine and a half, have now been obtained in considerable numbers, with a large
  quantity of fossil remains of the birds themselves; and in consequence about twelve species have
  been indicated, and a second genus, <i>Mullerornis</i>.<a id="NtA_35"
  href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> It is supposed that some of them were in existence not more than
  two hundred years ago. The most salient points of their structure are the long, stout legs, with
  four toes and broad flat metatarsi, the apparently rudimentary humeri, the absurdly short
  keel-less sternum, and the frontal pits, indicating a large crest, comparable to that supposed to
  have existed in certain of the Dinornithidae.<a id="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> The
  shell of the eggs, some of which contain two gallons, is used by the natives to hold liquor, and
  is slightly pitted.</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that, in the arrangement here followed, Dr. Gadow placed the <i><span
  class="sc">Stereornithes</span></i> under the head of Neornithes Ratitae, though not under that of
  Ratitae in the restricted <span class="pagenum" id="page44"><span
  class="smaller">{44}</span></span>sense; but it should be noted that their systematic position was
  not by any means assured, though justified by what was then known of these extraordinary fossils,
  of which the sternum has not even yet been brought to light. Remains of various forms, chiefly of
  gigantic size, have been disinterred from the Miocene strata of Santa Cruz in Patagonia, one of
  which (<i>Phororhachos</i>) was described in 1887 by Dr. Ameghino,<a id="NtA_37"
  href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> from its mandible as an Edentate Mammal, though four years
  later<a id="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> he arrived at the more correct conclusion
  that the jaw was to be referred to a bird. In 1891, moreover, Se&ntilde;ores Moreno and Mercerat<a
  id="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> proposed a new Order with the name of
  <i>Stereornithes</i>, when publishing a series of fine plates; while Dr. Ameghino, who criticised
  their work, reduced the nine genera created therein to the smaller number of three.<a id="NtA_40"
  href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> Another paper by the author last named,<a id="NtA_41"
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> and two by Mr. Lydekker<a id="NtA_42"
  href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> should be consulted by those interested in the details of the
  subject, while an admirable summary will be found in Professor Newton's <i>Dictionary of
  Birds</i>. In a review of Dr. Ameghino's paper on these birds,<a id="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> Mr. C. W. Andrews stated that <i>Phororhachos</i> and others of
  the "Stereornithes" were not truly Ratite, but were Carinate forms in which the wings had
  undergone reduction, and suggested that possibly they were related to the parent stock of the
  Gruiformes, approximating particularly to <i>Cariama</i> (<i>Dicholophus</i>). Shortly afterwards
  Dr. Ameghino's collection was acquired by the British Museum, and a study of the specimens
  themselves has not caused the reviewer to change his opinion.<a id="NtA_44"
  href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> Some members of the group (e.g. <i>Mesembriornis</i>) are
  perhaps truly Ratite, and one at least (<i>Dryornis</i>) belongs to the <i>Cathartidae</i>.
  <i>Phororhachos</i> is remarkable for the immense size and heavy build of the skull, to which the
  legs, huge though they sometimes are, bear no proportion; the maxilla is exceedingly compressed,
  yet very deep, and ends in a strong hook, while the long massive mandible curves upwards to meet
  it. There is a quite or nearly complete interorbital septum in this case, as opposed to
  <i>Apteryx</i>, and, to a considerable extent, to the Dinornithidae; <span class="pagenum"
  id="page45"><span class="smaller">{45}</span></span>while the nostrils are pervious, and the
  quadrate articulates with the skull by two heads, contrary to what occurs in the Ratitae proper.
  The furcula is existent, but extremely slender; the metatarsus is more or less elongated, the
  hallux is present, the wings are small but well developed, and the tail is said to be long, with a
  considerable number of separate vertebrae.</p>

  <p>This genus includes the species <i>P. longissimus</i>, <i>P. inflatus</i>, <i>P.
  platygnathus</i>, <i>P. modicus</i>, <i>P. gracilis</i>, and <i>P. sehuensis</i>;
  <i>Brontornis</i>, which has a shorter and wider mandible and smaller but stouter metatarsi,
  possesses in <i>B. burmeisteri</i> a form as large as <i>Aepyornis maximus</i>, while
  <i>Opisthodactylus</i> and other proposed genera are too imperfectly known to deserve
  consideration in our limited space.</p>

  <p>Besides the above, Dr. Gadow classed with the Stereornithes, <i>Diatryma</i> of New Mexico,
  known from a metatarsus; <i>Dasornis</i> of the London Clay, described from fragments of a skull;
  <i>Remiornis</i> from the neighbourhood of Rheims, of which several imperfect bones have been
  found; and <i>Gastornis</i> of both England and France, of which a fair number of parts have been
  unearthed. All occur in the Eocene, but the question of their relationship is by no means settled,
  and some writers consider <i>Gastornis</i> to be nearly allied to the Anseres. This form appears
  to have been of the size of an Ostrich, with long leg-bones and short weak wings, and was probably
  flightless. Three species have been propounded, <i>G. parisiensis</i>, <i>G. klaasseni</i>, and
  <i>G. edwardsi</i>.</p>

  <p>(B) With regard to the difficult question of the position in the system of the <b>Neornithes
  Odontolcae</b>, a few introductory words of explanation are necessary. In 1872 Professor Marsh
  bestowed upon two fossils from the Cretaceous deposits of Kansas the names of <i>Hesperornis</i>
  and <i>Ichthyornis</i>, which he proposed in the following year<a id="NtA_45"
  href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> to comprise in a Sub-class <i>Odontornithes</i>, so called from
  the presence of teeth in the jaws. Subsequently<a id="NtA_46" href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> he
  divided this Sub-class into two Orders, <i>Odontolcae</i> and <i>Odontotormae</i>, the former
  containing <i>Hesperornis</i>, with the teeth arranged in grooves, and the latter
  <i>Ichthyornis</i>, where they were placed in distinct sockets. His views have been controverted
  by many writers, but Mr. Lydekker&ndash;an authority of great weight in this connexion&ndash;while
  fully admitting the affinity of the first form to <span class="pagenum" id="page46"><span
  class="smaller">{46}</span></span>the Divers, and the resemblance of the second to the Gull-tribe,
  proposed in 1891<a id="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> to retain the term Odontornithes
  for a series of birds ancestral to the modern series of toothless Carinatae, for which he adopted
  the title <i>Euornithes</i>, used in a narrower sense by Dr. Stejneger. It has, however, been
  decided to follow Dr. Gadow on this point; while the marks of distinction given below make it seem
  at least probable that, whereas <i>Ichthyornis</i> may be referred to the Carinate division,
  <i>Hesperornis</i> should be placed in closer proximity to the Ratite forms. Our Neornithes
  Odontolcae consequently contain the <span class="sc">Hesperornithes</span>, the <span
  class="sc">Enaliornithes</span>, and <i>Baptornis</i>, all of which appear to be nearly
  related.</p>

  number being thirty or more below, but considerably less above, where they did not reach to the
  anterior extremity. The bill was long and pointed, the rami of the lower jaw being entirely
  separate; the head was rather small, the neck was long, and the quadrate bone articulated with the
  skull by one knob only. The sternum was long, broad, and flat, without keel; the furcula was
  decidedly reduced, the metatarsus was moderate and laterally compressed; there were four toes, all
  directed forwards and probably webbed; the wing was rudimentary, being little more than a humerus;
  the tail was fairly long and broad, but had no pygostyle. <i>Enaliornis barretti</i> and <i>E.
  sedgwicki</i> of the Cambridge Greensand had leg-bones very similar to the above, but being only
  known from fragmentary remains, their position is uncertain; while the same may be said of
  <i>Baptornis</i> of the North American Cretaceous strata, which, like the two last-named, is much
  smaller than <i>Hesperornis</i>.</p>

  with them in the aggregate. Claws on the manus are found on the pollex and index in certain of the

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. ICHTHYORNITHES.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">Enough has already been said with regard to the position of the Order
  Ichthyornithes, with its sole Family <b>Ichthyornithidae</b>; but it remains to discuss the
  several members. <i>Ichthyornis victor</i>, <i>I. dispar</i>, and the other species were small
  forms of about the size of a Partridge, with the habits and appearance, it is presumed, of Terns
  or Gulls.<a id="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> The head was extremely large <span
  class="pagenum" id="page49"><span class="smaller">{49}</span></span>in proportion to the remainder
  of the skeleton; the beak was long and pointed, with entirely separate rami to the mandible; the
  sharp teeth, fixed regularly in distinct sockets, were inclined backwards, and occupied the whole
  of the lower and at least the posterior half of the upper jaw; the keel of the sternum was large
  and broad; the dorsal and cervico-dorsal vertebrae were biconcave, as in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, and
  perhaps to some extent in <i>Enaliornis</i>; the quadrate articulated to the skull by one knob, as
  in the Neornithes Ratitae and Neornithes Odontolcae; the metatarsus was short and the whole foot
  small; a furcula was probably present; the wings were well developed, indicating great powers of
  flight; while the tail was comparatively short, and ended in a pygostyle. It will be observed that
  of these characters the formation of the jaw and its teeth, the biconcave vertebrae, and the
  articulation of the quadrate, are those that chiefly distinguish the Order from the rest of the
  Carinatae. <i>Apatornis celer</i>, also from the Cretaceous deposits of Kansas, is probably to be
  placed here, but other genera described from the same strata cannot yet be certainly classified.<a
  id="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. COLYMBIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The Colymbiformes constitute a very archaic Order of Birds, and hold a somewhat isolated
  position. Older writers combined them with the Alcidae as a group Pygopodes, but recent anatomical
  investigations make it clear that Auks have more affinity to Gulls, which again trend to the
  Limicoline alliance. As regards structure, the two Sub-Orders <span class="sc">Colymbi</span> and
  <span class="sc">Podicipedes</span>, with their Families <i>Colymbidae</i>, or Divers, and
  <i>Podicipedidae</i>, or Grebes, may be here treated together. They are all water-birds with
  webbed or lobed toes and extraordinarily flattened metatarsi. The sternum in the Colymbidae is
  much longer than broad, in the Podicipedidae short and wide, while the furcula is <span
  class="sans fwb">Y</span>-shaped; the neck is more or less elongated; the bill in the former
  Family is strong, straight, acute, and compressed, in the latter moderate and sometimes recurved,
  being either slender, as in <i>Aechmophorus</i>, or very stout, as in <i>Podilymbus</i>. The
  scutellated metatarsi are set very far back, and are fairly long, the procnemial process of the
  tibia being remarkably elongated, though Grebes alone have a distinct patella; the hallux is very
  small and has a small membrane, <span class="pagenum" id="page50"><span
  class="smaller">{50}</span></span>but whereas Divers have the anterior toes fully webbed, their
  allies have them surrounded by large lobes of skin, connected only at the base. The claws are
  abnormally broad and flat in Grebes, the outer margin of the third being serrated. In the
  Colymbidae the wing is short, narrow, and pointed, with eleven primaries and about twenty
  secondaries; in the Podicipedidae it is still shorter and concave in form, with twelve primaries
  but rarely twenty secondaries; in the latter no true rectrices can be distinguished, though a tuft
  of downy feathers exists, while in the former they are normal though much reduced, and number from
  eighteen to twenty. Grebes have bare lores, and are frequently adorned in the breeding season with
  crests or tippets of a golden or brownish colour; the dense glossy plumage being more commonly
  used for decorative purposes than the duller coats of Divers. The tongue is always long and
  pointed, the syrinx is tracheo-bronchial, the nostrils are pervious, an aftershaft is present, and
  both adults and young are uniformly downy. Fossil remains from the Oligocene of France and
  southern England, indicating a genus intermediate between the two Families, have been named
  <i>Colymbo&iuml;des</i>.<a id="NtA_50" href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Colymbidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Colymbus septentrionalis</i>, the Red-throated Diver of the
  Arctic and sub-Arctic parts of both worlds, is brownish black in summer, with white under-parts
  and white specks above; the head and neck are lead-coloured, except the nape, which is black with
  white streaks, and the mid-throat, which is reddish-chestnut. <i>C. arcticus</i>, the
  Black-throated Diver, found in the same regions though with a different distribution, as for
  instance in Scotland, is blacker, with white bars as well as spots; the crown and hind neck being
  ashy grey, the sides of the latter striped with black and white, and the throat purplish-black,
  interrupted by a semi-collar of white with vertical black lines. <i>C. pacificus</i> of western
  North America is barely separable. <i>C. glacialis</i>, the Great Northern Diver, has a much more
  restricted range, breeding in Iceland, Greenland, and the Fur Countries as far west as the Great
  Slave Lake, where it meets <i>C. adamsi</i> (hardly differing except in the yellowish-white bill),
  which extends thence to Northern Asia, and possibly to Spitsbergen and Jan Mayen. The former is
  black above, with belts of white spots making a "chess-board" pattern; the lower surface is <span
  class="pagenum" id="page51"><span class="smaller">{51}</span></span>white, and the throat is
  crossed by two bands of white with longitudinal black bars, while the head and neck are black with
  a purplish gloss, changing to green below. In winter most Divers are found down to the northern
  tropic, at which season the throat becomes white, as it is in the young, in which the feathers of
  the upper parts are duller with whitish edges. The sexes are similar; the bill is normally black,
  and the feet are bluish or greenish grey. The downy chicks are sooty above.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Divers are not usually gregarious, and unless driven by stormy weather to inland waters, are
  essentially marine, except during the breeding season, when they ascend the rivers and seek their
  customary nesting-sites on the moors, the Black-throated species showing a somewhat greater
  preference than the rest for islands in the lakes they frequent, but the Red-throated often
  selecting small pools, or even "flows," among the heather. The two eggs, greenish- or
  reddish-brown in hue, with blackish and grey blotches and spots, are laid on a mere depression in
  the grass or sand close to the water's edge, or upon a mass of green vegetation which is
  occasionally semi-natant. Incubation is said to last four weeks. As a rule the female performs
  this duty, lying flat upon her eggs, and gliding or scrambling off when disturbed, whence a
  distinct track is often visible upon the turf. On leaving the land a dive is taken <span
  class="pagenum" id="page52"><span class="smaller">{52}</span></span>to a considerable distance,
  then both parents swim towards the intruder with the body partly submerged, and finally, if
  thoroughly scared, they rise heavily on the wing to circle round with outstretched neck before
  betaking themselves with rapid but laboured flight to some neighbouring lake, from which they
  return at intervals until the coast is clear. They descend from aloft noisily and with great
  impetus, the splashing plunge being followed by a gliding movement, leaving a broad furrow behind,
  while on land they move with difficulty, and rest on the metatarsus. Their croak, or loud, clear,
  melancholy cry is often heard before storms, whence the Red-throated Diver is called Rain-goose in
  Scotland; the food consists chiefly of fish, brought to the surface and swallowed with a jerk, but
  crustaceans, molluscs, and perhaps aquatic insects vary the diet. The young take to the water
  readily, but the female occasionally carries them on her back.</p>

  <p>Both Divers and Grebes swim strongly, the flat of the metatarsus meeting the water during the
  back stroke, and the thin edge on the return. When submerged they do not use the pinions.</p>

  <p>Fam. II. In the <b>Podicipedidae</b> both sexes are mainly dusky brown or blackish grey above,
  and silvery white below, often with some white on the wing; so it will only be necessary to note
  hereafter the distinctive ornaments or bright colours which are invariably lost in winter.
  <i>Podicipes fluviatilis</i>, the Little Grebe or Dabchick, ranging over Europe, Africa, and Asia
  to the Malay Countries and North Australia, has rich chestnut cheeks, throat, and sides of the
  neck, horn-coloured bill, and greenish feet. In winter the chestnut fades to buff with a white
  chin. Count Salvadori<a id="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> considers <i>P. gularis</i>
  of Australia and Papuasia and <span class="pagenum" id="page53"><span
  class="smaller">{53}</span></span><i>P. tricolor</i> of the Moluccas separable, <i>P. pelzelni</i>
  of Madagascar being hardly so. <i>P. dominicus</i>, extending from the southern United States to
  Patagonia, differs in its black throat. The Little Grebe breeds commonly in Britain, while <i>P.
  cristatus</i>, the Great Crested Grebe or Loon, only nests on our largest waters, covering,
  however, a wide range in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. It has a bifurcate
  crest of brown, a chestnut ruff tipped with black round the cheeks and throat, a red base to the
  bill and greenish feet. <i>P. griseigena</i>, the Red-necked Grebe, which wanders to our shores,
  but breeds in the north of the Palaearctic and Nearctic Regions, and perhaps occasionally in
  Morocco, has the foreneck chestnut, a line above the cheeks white, and the base of the bill
  yellow. Some writers denominate the North American and East Asiatic form, <i>P. holboelli</i>.
  <i>P. auritus</i>, the Slavonian Grebe of the sub-Arctic portions of both worlds, has a tuft of
  golden chestnut feathers on each side of the head, an ample black ruff, rufous chest and flanks,
  black bill and greenish feet; <i>P. nigricollis</i>, the Eared Grebe, of Central and Southern
  Europe, Africa, temperate Asia, and western North America, has merely golden ear-tufts, with a
  black chest. Both visit us at certain seasons. Finally, <i>P. nestor</i> inhabits South Australia;
  <i>P. rufipectus</i> New Zealand; <i>P. caliparaeus</i>, <i>P. rollandi</i>, and <i>Aechmophorus
  major</i> America south of Peru and Brazil; <i>Ae. occidentalis</i> western North America;
  <i>Podilymbus podiceps</i> nearly all the New World: and <i>Centropelma micropterum</i> Lake
  Titicaca only. The first two have white hair-like filaments on the head, the third and fourth
  elongated ear-coverts of golden brown or black and white; while <i>Podilymbus</i> is remarkable
  for its stout whitish bill with median black band and its black throat, <i>Centropelma</i> for its
  aborted wings and flightless condition. <i>Podicipes taczanowskii</i>, of Lake Junin in Peru,
  differs from <i>P. caliparaeus</i> in its longer and lighter bill and feet, and grey-brown
  ear-coverts. Grebes in the down are streaked with white or buff on a dusky ground, while some have
  a naked red space on the crown.</p>

  <p class="sp3">These migratory birds frequent reedy streams and stagnant waters in summer, being
  companionable, though not gregarious; hard weather, however, drives them to the sea. They walk
  fairly well, though awkwardly, and sit upon the whole metatarsus; but the chicks progress on "all
  fours," using the wings almost <span class="pagenum" id="page54"><span
  class="smaller">{54}</span></span>as forefeet.<a id="NtA_52" href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
  They fly straight and rapidly, with head and feet extended, but have difficulty in leaving the
  water; they dive at the slightest alarm, their quick sight enabling them to vanish below the
  surface at the flash of a gun, to reappear, with hardly a ripple, at a distance. Frequently it
  requires much patience to obtain a second view, as their bodies can be submerged to any extent,
  and at times the bill alone is exposed. In swimming they jerk the head and often rise vertically
  to shake their wings. They descend from the air with a splash and a glide, while in diving the
  feet alone act as oars, the young soon equalling their parents in this respect. The note is a
  harsh croak in the larger forms, a softer sound or whit-whit in the smaller; the food consists of
  fish when procurable, but small reptiles, amphibians, molluscs, crustaceans, insects, and
  vegetable matter are frequently added, and feathers of some size are constantly found in the
  stomach. The nest, a pile of aquatic weeds or rushes of varying bulk, is fixed among reeds,
  sedges, semi-natant masses of herbage, or, more rarely, upon low branches of trees or bushes
  verging upon the water. Should this rise higher, fresh materials are added. From three to six
  bluish-white eggs with a smooth chalky covering are laid in a slight depression above, but being
  covered with wet weeds by the female on leaving, soon become stained with brown. The bill is used
  in concealing them, nor does an invader's presence usually hinder the operation. Incubation lasts
  from twenty-one to twenty-four days. Both sexes are said to assist, and the mother carries the
  nestlings on her back, or even dives with them in that position.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. SPHENISCIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The Order Sphenisciformes, with its Sub-Order <span class="sc">Sphenisci</span>, contains only
  those remarkable marine birds the Penguins (Fam. <b>Spheniscidae</b>), the life of which is
  chiefly spent on the stormy waters of the Antarctic seas. Coupled by former writers with the Auks,
  their northern analogues, it has now been shown that the slight external similarity of the two
  groups is utterly misleading, the nearest allies of the primitive forms here treated being the
  Petrels on the one hand and the Divers and Grebes on the other. Their unique structure is
  correlated with very peculiar habits.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page55"><span class="smaller">{55}</span></span></div>

  <p>The horny sheath of the maxilla is composed of from three to five more or less distinct pieces,
  while the powerful bill may be long, thin, and slightly decurved, as in <i>Aptenodytes</i> and
  <i>Pygosceles</i>; shorter and pretty broad, as in <i>Eudyptes</i>; or very stout, short, and
  compressed, as in <i>Spheniscus</i>, where the prominent hook of the culmen overhangs a truncated
  mandible. The three metatarsals are not completely fused as in other birds (<span class="wnw">p.
  <a href="#page10">10</a></span>), the scutellated metatarsus itself being shorter and broader than
  in any other Family, except the Fregatidae; the legs are set far back, the tibia is hardly
  visible, and the short thick toes are directed forwards, the small hallux alone having no web.
  Even more striking are the wings, which are totally devoid of normally-developed quills, though
  the number of feathers is very large, the primaries themselves amounting to about thirty-six;
  these flippers or paddles have highly compressed bones with no power of flexure, but work freely
  from the shoulder in rotatory fashion, requiring a corresponding increase of strength in the
  muscles of the neighbouring parts. The numerous rectrices are fairly long and stiff in
  <i>Aptenodytes</i>, <i>Pygosceles</i>, and <i>Eudyptes</i>, but shorter in <i>Spheniscus</i>,
  having considerably reduced vanes. On the body we find no naked tracts, but a uniform covering of
  small scale-like feathers, with or without barbs, and an equally uniform distribution of down both
  in adults and young; the moult, moreover, is accomplished in an exceptional manner, the plumage
  being shed in masses, and that of the wing gradually flaking off above the new coat. The process
  apparently occupies about ten days.<a id="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> Long
  superciliary crests occur in <i>Eudyptes</i>, the mandible is more or less feathered in
  <i>Aptenodytes</i> and <i>Pygosceles</i>, and the metatarsi are clothed besides in <i>A.
  forsteri</i>. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the syrinx tracheo-bronchial,
  the tongue rudimentary, an after-shaft is present, and the plentiful subcutaneous fat produces a
  marketable oil.</p>

  <p>Penguins<a id="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> have been said to derive their name
  from the Latin <i>pinguis</i> (fat) or the English "pin-wing," <i>i.e.</i> pinioned wing, but such
  nautical appellations are usually obscure. The French term them "Manchots." These birds rest on
  the whole metatarsus, the bill usually pointing upwards; their gait on land is ludicrous, but
  often fast, a vertical position being generally preserved, while they endeavour to waddle along on
  their toes with constant flapping of the pinions, every now and then partially losing their
  balance <span class="pagenum" id="page56"><span class="smaller">{56}</span></span>and regaining it
  by the aid of their flippers. Several species are called Rock-hoppers, from their manner of
  hopping upon the boulders. They are, however, rarely seen on land, except in the breeding season,
  though equally gregarious at all times, swimming in "schools" and resorting in vast numbers to
  their "rookeries." When submerged, the wings act as paddles with alternating rotatory action, and
  the feet as rudders; but on the return to the surface the latter naturally become the propellers.
  The note is a croak, a scream, a murmuring sound, or, in the young, a whistle. The food of
  crustaceans, cephalopods, and other molluscs, is varied by fish or a little vegetable matter, and
  accompanied by a mass of pebbles, often ejected near the breeding places. The nest of grass and
  leaves&ndash;more rarely of twigs, pebbles, clay or rubbish, when herbage is scarce&ndash;may be
  in burrows, among tussocks, under stones, in caves, or in the open; the two coarse-flavoured eggs
  being white or greenish-white, with a variable amount of chalky incrustation. The male is said to
  assist in incubation, which lasts about six weeks; the parents sit very closely and feed the blind
  young for an exceptionally long period, by inserting their bill in that of the nestling.
  Pugnacious and thievish towards one another, Penguins are usually fearless on land, though, when
  they are irritated, the beak can inflict a very severe bite.</p>

  <p>The range extends southwards from the Gal&aacute;pagos round Cape Horn to the Falkland Islands, a few
  stragglers reaching Brazil; thence breeding stations are found eastwards in Tristan da Cunha, off
  the Cape of Good Hope, in the Crozets, Marion, and Amsterdam Islands, Kerguelen Land, and so on to
  the south of Australia and New Zealand, with the Antarctic regions as far as man has penetrated.
  The largest form is <i>Aptenodytes forsteri</i>, and the smallest <i>Spheniscus minor</i>, about
  36 and 19 inches long respectively; the sexes are alike in colour, or the female may be a little
  duller and resemble the young. The bill and feet are usually reddish-brown, black or grey, but the
  latter may be whitish. The nestling in down is blackish- or yellowish-brown with white lower
  parts.</p>

  <p><i>A. forsteri</i>, the Emperor Penguin of Victoria Land and the adjacent seas, is
  blackish-grey, with white breast and belly and an oval yellow spot on each side of the head. It is
  particularly tame, and moves at a marvellous rate by lying on the snow and propelling itself with
  its feet.<a id="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> <i>A. pennanti</i>, the King Penguin of
  <span class="pagenum" id="page57"><span class="smaller">{57}</span></span>Kerguelen Land, the
  Falklands, Crozets, Auckland, Macquarie, Campbell, and other southern islands, apparently
  confounded with the last-named under the title of <i>A. patagonica</i>, is distinguishable by the
  longer bill, more orange chest, and lack of feathers on the sides of the mandible and metatarsus.
  The crowded breeding grounds are flat spaces of hard soil covered with slime, and are often quite
  apart from the general quarters. When disturbed the birds utter a loud "urr-urr-urr," and run to
  the sea at a great pace, maintaining an upright position; while they pass to and from the water
  singly, and not in flocks, as do other species.<a id="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
  The pyriform eggs are sometimes held up by the parents' feet. <i>Pygosceles taeniata</i>, the
  "Gentoo," of similar but more restricted range, is bluish-black above and on the throat, having
  the lower parts, the margins of the flippers, and a band across the crown white. Dense colonies
  are found both near the sea and several miles inland, a regular path being often beaten down by
  the birds traversing it in company; the nests consist of a little herbage in a hollow, or are
  small conical mounds of stones and clay, lined with feathers and down, the oval eggs being
  frequently of unequal size. The note is an unmelodious bark.<a id="NtA_57"
  href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> <i>P. adeliae</i> inhabits the icy regions of the far south.</p>

  <p><i>Spheniscus demersus</i>, the Cape Penguin or Jackass, ranging from western South America to
  South Africa, has bluish-black upper parts and throat, and white lower surface crossed by a
  blackish band&ndash;or two in the variety <i>magellanicus</i>. The note is a harsh bray; the eggs
  are either deposited in burrows&ndash;presumably dug by the parent itself&ndash;or, as on rocky
  islands near the Cape, in nests of pebbles and rubbish, commonly placed under large stones.<a
  id="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> <i>S.</i> (<i>Eudyptula</i>) <i>minor</i> is a bluer
  species with white throat, that part being dark coloured in the whole Family except here and in
  <i>Eudyptes antarcticus</i>; it occupies the south of Australia and the New Zealand area. The note
  is a loud croak or growl, and the oval but somewhat pointed eggs are laid on a bed of leaves and
  grass in an excavation in the soil or a crevice among rocks.<a id="NtA_59"
  href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> <i>S. mendiculus</i>, the only tropical form, occurs in the
  Gal&aacute;pagos.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page58"><span class="smaller">{58}</span></span></div>

  <p>The genus <i>Eudyptes</i> contains the crested "Maccaroni" Penguins or Rock-hoppers, of which
  <i>E. chrysocome</i>, figured below, extends southwards and eastwards from the Falklands through
  the Indian Ocean and Antarctic seas to the coasts of New Zealand and the neighbouring islands. It
  is bluish-black with white breast and belly, and a fine orange crest on each side of the crown,
  from which a broad golden streak passes over the eye to the base of the maxilla.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>E. chrysolophus</i>, a rarer bird of somewhat similar range, has the forehead yellow instead
  of black. <i>E. chrysocome</i> nidificates on elevated slopes, usually near fresh water, in which
  it delights to bathe, the nest being either a mere depression in the bare earth or a slight
  structure of plant-stems and leaves. This is at times perfectly exposed, but is not unfrequently
  among boulders or under the shade of tussocks of grass as high as a man's head, the filthy
  breeding-places being intersected by beaten pathways formed by the constant passage of troops to
  and from the sea. The parent is said to sit almost perpendicularly, with the eggs closely applied
  to a naked space in the centre of the abdomen, but it should be mentioned that some observers
  state that the breast is lowered until it nearly touches the ground, though there seems to be
  little doubt that the position is at least half upright in the case of Penguins generally. Like
  other species, Rock-hoppers swim chiefly below the surface of the sea, coming into view only <span
  class="pagenum" id="page59"><span class="smaller">{59}</span></span>from time to time to breathe;
  but they have a most curious habit of stretching out the legs below the tail, laying their wings
  flat to their sides, arching their necks forward, and then making a sudden spring clear out of the
  waves. An occasional croak is heard while the birds are in the water, but on land the barking
  noise is perfectly deafening, nor do the severe bites with which the intruder is greeted make
  matters more tolerable.<a id="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> Among other species
  recognised by different writers are <i>E. antarcticus</i> of the Falklands, South Orkneys, South
  Shetlands, and New Georgia; <i>E. antipodum</i> of New Zealand and Campbell Island, with an almost

  <p class="ac"><b>Order IV. PROCELLARIIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The Procellariiformes, or Petrels, are archaic ocean forms with great powers of flight, often
  placed near the Laridae on account of a supposed external resemblance, though the structure of the
  internal parts shews this to be misleading, and indicates rather a position between the
  Sphenisciformes and Ciconiiformes.</p>

  <p>The single Sub-Order <span class="sc">Tubinares</span>, with the Family <i>Procellariidae</i>,
  may be subdivided into the Sub-families: (1) <i>Diomedeinae</i>, or Albatroses; (2)
  <i>Oceanitinae</i> and (3) <i>Procellariinae</i>, or Fulmars, Shearwaters, and Petrels proper; and
  (4) <i>Pelecano&iuml;dinae</i>, or Diving Petrels.<a id="NtA_63" href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fam. <b>Procellariidae</b>.&ndash;In the larger species the bill is long, stout, and frequently
  compressed, with a strong sharp hook overhanging the truncated mandible; its size gradually
  diminishing throughout the Sub-Families in very much the above order. The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page60"><span class="smaller">{60}</span></span>horny sheath is separated by grooves into more
  or less distinct plates, and the mandible may also be grooved, as in <i>Phoebetria</i>; while
  <i>Prion</i> is especially remarkable for the curious fringe of transverse lamellae on the margins
  of the broad maxilla, which recall those of the Duck tribe, traces of the same being exhibited by
  <i>Ossifraga</i>, <i>Fulmarus</i>, <i>Daption</i>, and <i>Halobaena</i>. The most striking
  peculiarity, however, is the tubular structure of the impervious nostrils, which trenchantly
  divides the Petrels from all other Birds; these tubes are far apart in the Diomedeinae, and lie
  laterally towards the back of the culmen; in the remaining groups they are fused together and are
  situated dorsally. In the Oceanitinae the single aperture looks forwards and upwards, but in the
  Procellariinae the septum is produced to the front, showing clearly the double nature of the
  formation; in <i>Pelecanoides</i> again the distinct openings are almost vertical, an arrangement
  as well adapted to the diving habits as are the long sternum and the compressed wing-bones. The
  rows of retroverted spines found on the palatal membrane in most of the family no doubt aid in the
  retention of slippery prey, as do the lamellae in <i>Prion</i>. The lower portion of the tibia is
  bare; the metatarsus varies in length and stoutness according to the species, though often
  decidedly slender, and is much compressed in <i>Puffinus</i> and its nearest allies. It is usually
  covered with hexagonal scales, but <i>Oceanites</i> and <i>Cymodroma</i> show but one long
  anterior scute (<i>ocrea</i>), while <i>Garrodia</i> and <i>Pelagodroma</i> have a series of
  oblique plates instead. The hallux is absent in <i>Pelecanoides</i>, and consists of only one
  phalanx elsewhere, being quite rudimentary in the Diomedeinae; it is slightly above the level of
  the anterior toes, which are connected by large webs. The claws are, as a rule, sharp, curved, and
  compressed, but are blunt and much flattened in <i>Pelagodroma</i>, <i>Pealea</i>, and
  <i>Cymodroma</i>, showing a similar tendency in others of the Oceanitinae. The wings are normally
  long, and are very narrow and pointed in the Diomedeinae, where the expanse is vast, but in
  <i>Pelecanoides</i> they are decidedly short: the primaries are eleven in number; the secondaries
  are ten or less in the Oceanitinae, thirteen of more in the remaining forms, and amount to more
  than thirty in some of the Diomedeinae. The tail is rarely long, as in <i>Phoebetria</i>, and may
  be even, rounded, graduated, or emarginated; the above species, <i>Bulweria</i>, and some forms of
  <i>Puffinus</i> have it wedge-shaped, while <span class="pagenum" id="page61"><span
  class="smaller">{61}</span></span>a distinct fork occurs in <i>Oceanodroma</i>. Sixteen rectrices
  are found in <i>Ossifraga</i>, fourteen in <i>Fulmarus</i>, <i>Priocella</i>, and <i>Daption</i>,
  twelve elsewhere. The small tongue is somewhat triangular, being rather larger in <i>Ossifraga</i>
  and <i>Prion</i>; the syrinx is tracheo-bronchial; and an after-shaft is present, though in some
  cases rudimentary.</p>

  <p>The soft, dense plumage shows various patterns of black, brown, grey, and white; the bill and
  feet may be black, brown, flesh- or horn-tinted, yellow, orange, or parti-coloured, but in
  <i>Prion</i> and <i>Halobaena</i> the latter are bluish. Light and dark phases are not uncommon,
  as in <i>Fulmarus</i> and <i>Ossifraga</i>; the sexes are invariably similar; and the nestlings,
  which long remain helpless, are clad in thick down of a black, brown, grey, or white hue, through
  which the feathers appear gradually. Some white Albatroses have intermediate dusky stages of
  plumage, and do not gain the adult coloration at once, as most of the Family seem to do.</p>

  <p><i>Diomedea exulans</i> is one of the largest birds that fly, exceeding a goose in size, while
  the smaller Petrels are hardly bigger than Finches. The range of the Order is world-wide, though a
  majority of species frequent the desolate tracts and islands of the southern oceans; but even
  Albatroses breed in the North Pacific.</p>

  <p>Though the members of this Family can hardly be called gregarious, flocks of Shearwaters,
  Fulmars, and so forth are by no means an uncommon sight from shipboard, and settlements are formed
  in the breeding season, which is almost the only occasion on which they voluntarily seek dry land.
  Albatroses, Fulmars, the "Cape Pigeon" (<i>Daption</i>), and other allied forms are observed most
  commonly in the daytime, whereas those that nest under cover are to a great extent nocturnal
  during incubation, and are generally seen or heard after dusk. While the whole group is oceanic,
  there is a wide difference between the powerful Albatros and its smaller and weaker relations in
  that respect, the latter journeying but little from the immediate neighbourhood of their homes,
  and not accompanying ships for long distances in the same way as the former. In the larger species
  the flight is strong and graceful,<a id="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> accompanied by
  circling, soaring, or sailing movements, the feet being extended below the tail; Shearwaters skim
  the waves in a curious twisting fashion, and the lesser Petrels flit with greater action of the
  wing close to the <span class="pagenum" id="page62"><span
  class="smaller">{62}</span></span>surface, upon which they paddle to assist themselves. The Diving
  Petrels&ndash;and their allies to a limited extent&ndash;plunge through or beneath the billows,
  while all species may be noticed at times resting or swimming upon the water. Equally at home in
  storm or calm, they pass the greater part of their lives upon the ocean, and it seems impossible
  to doubt the fact that they sleep there also. Great difficulty is experienced in rising from a
  level surface, whether it be the deck of a ship or a grassy flat; the birds scrambling along with
  flapping wings and occasional aid from the bill, until some slight declivity or broken edge
  enables them to obtain a start. When taken from a nest in a burrow, they either drop to the ground
  like stones, or flutter off in a dazed condition, which lasts for several seconds, and renders
  them absolutely helpless. The cry is said in various cases to resemble a bray, a croak, a harsh
  cackle, a diabolical scream, a puppy's whine, or a soft whistle, while the twittering or "singing"
  of <i>Procellaria</i>, <i>Oceanodroma</i>, and <i>Oceanites</i> in their holes is well known to
  those who have visited a Storm Petrel's colony. The food consists of fish, crustaceans,
  cephalopods and other molluscs, jellyfish, and the like, Albatroses and Fulmars being said to
  force other species to part with their booty after the manner of Skuas, or even to devour
  nestlings. Herbage is rarely found in the stomach, but blubber of dead animals and scraps thrown
  from shipboard are eagerly swallowed, so that many of the largest forms are captured by concealing
  a hook in a piece of pork and trailing it in the water on a cork, when the bait is often greedily
  contested by every individual in the vicinity. Albatroses and other members of the Family which
  will take food from the surface of the sea descend upon it with elevated wings, to rise again with
  the morsel obtained, or to float upon the waves while enjoying it; Shearwaters commonly dash down
  with considerable impetus, and disappear after their prey for the moment; while the Diving Petrels
  procure their nourishment at a much greater depth. When handled, and perhaps especially when taken
  from a nesting-hole, the birds bite severely, and eject a quantity of amber-coloured or greenish
  oil from the beak, followed as a rule by semi-digested food, the fluid possessing a strong smell
  of musk, which is also perceptible in the feathers and the eggs. The nest of the Albatros is
  usually a truncated cone or cylinder of mud, grass, leaves, and moss, with a slight <span
  class="pagenum" id="page63"><span class="smaller">{63}</span></span>depression on the top,
  colonies being formed on cliffs, rocky slopes, or bare hill-tops above the limit of trees; the
  Giant Petrel makes a similar structure at no great elevation; Shearwaters and their nearest allies
  collect a mass of grass and rubbish in a burrow scraped in a bank, among boulders, or in holes and
  crevices of rocks, accommodating themselves to little stone huts, provided by the fishermen, in
  the Canary and Salvage Islands.<a id="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> Fulmars scrape a
  cup-shaped hollow on ledges of precipices, adding little or no lining, while most of the remaining
  forms utilise small burrows, or crannies among the scattered stones which collect upon the shores
  or at the base of cliffs. A single lack-lustre white egg is deposited, frequently marked with a
  ring of rusty spots towards the larger end, especially in the case of the lesser species. Adult
  and young Shearwaters are eaten by the natives of the Canaries, the islands of Scotland, Ireland,
  and elsewhere, <i>Puffinus brevicauda</i> being the "Mutton-bird" of Australia, and <i>P.
  anglorum</i> being termed "Fachach" in the Hebrides and North Ireland. In the case of
  <i>Pelagodroma</i>, we have positive evidence that both sexes incubate;<a id="NtA_66"
  href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> and before the eggs are laid the parents are not uncommonly
  found together in the hole when such a site is chosen. Incubation lasts from twenty-five to sixty
  days.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Diomedeinae.</i>&ndash;This contains two genera, <i>Phoebetria</i> and
  <i>Diomedea</i>, of which the former has one member, <i>P. fuliginosa</i>, of a sooty grey colour,
  distinguished from its allies by the sulcated mandible and cuneate tail. It frequents the South
  Seas, while straying to Oregon, as does <i>Diomedea culminata</i>; and has similar manners to
  other Albatroses. <i>Diomedea exulans</i>, the Wandering Albatros, or "Cape Sheep," of the
  Southern Oceans generally, is white with narrow dusky undulations above and almost black wings;
  and particulars of the habits having been already given, it only remains to refer to the majestic
  flight, described by Professor Hutton as follows: "With outstretched, motionless wings he sails
  over the surface of the sea, now rising high in the air, now with a bold sweep, and wings inclined
  at an angle with the horizon, descending until the tip of the lower one all but touches the crests
  of the waves as he skims over them. Suddenly he sees something floating on the water and prepares
  to alight; but how changed he now is from the noble bird but a moment before, all grace and
  symmetry.</p>

  <p>He raises his wings, his head goes back, and his back goes in; down drop two enormous webbed
  feet straddled out to their full extent, and with a hoarse croak, between the cry of a Raven and
  that of a sheep, he falls 'souse' into the water. Here he is at home again, breasting the waves
  like a cork. Presently he stretches out his neck, and with great exertion of his wings runs along
  the top of the water for seventy or eighty yards, until, at last, having got sufficient impetus,
  he tucks up his legs, and is once more fairly launched in the air."<a id="NtA_67"
  href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> <i>D. regia</i>, of the New Zealand seas, has no undulations on
  the back; the similar <i>D. chionoptera</i>, of the Southern Indian Ocean, has nearly white

  smaller forms, or Mollymauks (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page65">65</a></span>), <i>D.
  irrorata</i>, of West Peru, is sooty-brown with plentiful white mottlings and white head; <i>D.

  tail <span class="pagenum" id="page65"><span class="smaller">{65}</span></span>and bill, and near
  the eye; <i>D. immutabilis</i>, found from Laysan to Japan, is darker, with white head, neck,
  rump, base of tail, and lower parts; <i>D. melanophrys</i>, of the southern oceans, which has
  occurred in California, and in summer in England as well as at the Faeroes,<a id="NtA_68"
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> is white, with a blackish band on each side of the eye, slaty
  back, brownish-black wings, and grey tail; <i>D. bulleri</i>, of the New Zealand seas, is
  greyish-brown, with white rump and lower surface, and ashy or whitish head; <i>D. culminata</i>
  and <i>D. chlororhyncha</i>, of the southern oceans, <i>D. cauta</i> of Tasmania, <i>D.
  salvini</i> of the New Zealand Seas, and <i>D. layardi</i> of those of the Cape, have similarly
  coloured plumage; the last five being distinguished by some writers as <i>Thalassogeron</i>, and
  having a strip of naked skin between the plates of the maxilla towards its base. <i>D. bulleri</i>
  has red, <i>D. chlororhyncha</i> flesh-coloured, and the others yellow feet; the amount of yellow
  on the bill varying with the species.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Oceanitinae.</i>&ndash;The genera recognised are <i>Cymodroma</i>,
  <i>Pealea</i>, <i>Pelagodroma</i>, <i>Garrodia</i>, and <i>Oceanites</i>; they are sooty- or
  slaty-black birds, of small size, having in some cases the rump, under parts, nuchal collar,
  forehead, superciliary streaks, or margins to the feathers of the dorsal region white. Their range
  extends over different portions of the southern seas, whence <i>Oceanites oceanicus</i>, Wilson's
  Petrel, has strayed to Labrador and Great Britain, and <i>Pelagodroma marina</i> to the latter and
  Massachusetts, while breeding in the Salvage Islands south of Madeira and the Cape Verds. The
  habits do not seem to differ appreciably from those of the Storm-Petrel.<a id="NtA_69"
  href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Procellariinae.</i>&ndash;As here arranged, this comprises three groups typified
  by the Fulmars, Shearwaters, and Storm-Petrels respectively. Of the first, <i>Ossifraga
  gigantea</i>, the Giant Petrel, or "Nelly" of the southern seas, recorded also from Oregon, is
  dark brown, often with white on the head when immature, and sometimes almost entirely white.
  <i>Fulmarus glacialis</i> of the North Atlantic, the Fulmar of St. Kilda, and the true Mollymauk
  of sailors, which is represented in the North Pacific by the barely separable <i>F. glupischa</i>
  and <i>F. rodgersi</i>, is bluish-grey with dusky quills, white head, neck, and lower parts; the
  dark phase being uniform dusky grey. It is smaller <span class="pagenum" id="page66"><span
  class="smaller">{66}</span></span>than <i>Ossifraga</i>, yet equal to a medium-sized Gull, though
  easily distinguished by its light gliding flight with little motion of the wings; in rough weather
  it skims very near the waves, while the croaking note is seldom heard. <i>Daption capensis</i>,
  the Cape-Pigeon, ranging from Ceylon and Peru throughout the southern oceans, is black and white
  above and nearly white below; it is well known as a constant companion of ships, especially off
  South Africa, hovering or swimming around, uttering its harsh cackle, or plunging into the water
  to fight for scraps thrown overboard. <i>Halobaena caerulea</i>, extending from lat. 40&deg; to 60&deg;
  S., is grey-blue above and white below, with a little white on the head, scapulars, and tail; the
  habits resembling those of <i>Prion</i>, a genus of four species, remarkable for the fringe of
  lamellae on the bill, and having blue-grey upper parts varied with black, white under parts and
  superciliary streak. These forms are found throughout the southern seas, while <i>P. ariel</i> has
  occurred in Madeira. <i>P. desolatus</i>, the Whale-bird of sailors, is frequently seen flitting
  round vessels, uttering its whistling or cooing note, or taking food from the water upon the wing;
  the slight nest is formed in an extremely small burrow.</p>

  <p>Little object would be served by describing in detail the twenty members of <i>Puffinus</i>
  (Shearwater) or the thirty of <i>Oestrelata</i>, the main constituents of our second group of
  Procellariinae. The former are sooty-brown or greyish, commonly with white below, and in some
  cases with white or pale edges to the feathers above; all are much alike except the uniform
  species, but it should be carefully noted that Petrels are often best distinguished by the colour
  of the bill and feet. The habits of these birds, which are distributed throughout the greater part
  of the world, have been already sufficiently treated. <i>P. anglorum</i>, the "Manx" Shearwater,
  breeds along the west of Great Britain, in the Orkneys, Shetlands, and Ireland, <i>P. major</i> or
  <i>gravis</i>, <i>P. griseus</i>, <i>P. obscurus</i>, <i>P. assimilis</i>, and <i>P.
  yelkouanus</i>, the &acirc;me damn&eacute;e of the Bosphorus, being occasional visitors to our shores. In
  <i>Oestrelata</i> the coloration is grey, brown, or blackish, with a decided tendency to lighter
  margins on the upper feathers, and in a few of the members more or less white on the tail, wing,
  or head; the under parts, moreover, being frequently white. The various forms reach from the
  southern temperate regions to Japan and also to Britain, where <i>Oe. haesitata</i> and <i>Oe.
  brevipes</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page67"><span class="smaller">{67}</span></span>have each
  been recorded once. The latter breeds on mountain-tops in islands, and of its other congeners some
  at least do likewise, many having an extremely limited range at all seasons.</p>

  <p><i>Priofinus cinereus</i>, the "Night-hawk," perhaps more noisy at night than even certain
  Shearwaters, is greyish-brown above and white below; it inhabits the southern oceans.
  <i>Thalassaeca antarctica</i>, restricted to the Antarctic regions, is brown with white lower
  parts and some white on the wing, tail, and their coverts. <i>Priocella glacialo&iuml;des</i> of the
  southern seas, which ranges northwards to Washington State in the Pacific, and seems to have the
  habits of a Fulmar, resembles that bird in its pearl-grey hue, with nearly white head, neck, and
  under surface. <i>Majaqueus aequinoctialis</i> of the regions south of lat. 30&deg; S., known as the
  "Cape Hen," is sooty-black with a white chin, <i>M. parkinsoni</i> of New Zealand being uniform in
  tint. The cry is a soft whistle, but the manners are in other respects as in Shearwaters, except
  that a conical nest is constructed in a burrow, whence a curious cackling noise issues during the
  period of incubation.<a id="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> <i>Pagodroma nivea</i>, of
  the icy regions of the south, is pure white with black bill and yellowish feet; it remains on the
  wing until late at night, and resembles <i>Prion</i> generally in its ways. <i>Bulweria
  bulweri</i>, met with once in England, inhabits the temperate parts of the North Atlantic and the
  North Pacific, and breeds as near us as the Desertas; it is almost uniform sooty-brown, and has
  the habits of a Storm-Petrel rather than of a Shearwater, being bold but wary, and rapid in
  flight, with a loud, cheerful quadruple note. It lays its pure white eggs without any nest in
  crevices of rocks, breeding as late as June near Madeira. <i>B. macgillivrayi</i>, with stouter
  bill, is known from the Fijian waters.</p>

  <p>Our third group includes the true Storm-Petrels (<i>Procellaria</i>) and their close allies the
  Fork-tailed Petrels (<i>Oceanodroma</i>), as well as <i>Halocyptena microsoma</i>, a dark blackish
  bird from Western America, between California and Panama. <i>P. pelagica</i> of the Mediterranean
  and North Atlantic from Greenland to South Africa, which breeds in Scotland, Ireland, and the West
  of England, is sooty-black with the tail-coverts white, except at the tips, and a little white on
  the wing-coverts. Named Mother Carey's Chicken by sailors, who look upon it with superstitious
  dread, it is often seen paddling along the waves in <span class="pagenum" id="page68"><span
  class="smaller">{68}</span></span>stormy weather, thus gaining the name of "Petrel" from the
  Apostle Peter; while it may be heard singing among the boulders towards the end of June in
  Scotland, where it breeds more than a month later than the "Lyrie" or Manx Shearwater. The note is
  shrill and the flight somewhat butterfly-like. <i>P. tethys</i>, of the Galapagos and Western
  Central America, has entirely white tail-coverts. <i>Oceanodroma</i> contains ten members
  inhabiting the northern hemisphere, and ranging southwards to Peru and St. Helena, all being
  sooty-black except <i>O. furcata</i>, which is chiefly ashy-grey, and <i>O. hornbyi</i>, which is
  brown, with white collar, forehead, and under surface, and blacker head and wings. <i>O.
  leucorrhoa</i> (Leach's Petrel) and <i>O. cryptoleucura</i> possess white tail-coverts tipped with
  black; the former having some breeding stations in Britain at St. Kilda and a few islands on the
  west of Scotland and Ireland, and the latter as far north as Madeira, though it extends to St.
  Helena, the Galapagos, and the Sandwich Islands, and has recently occurred in England. The other
  species are apparently met with only in the Pacific north of Panama, while in habits the genus is
  not dissimilar to <i>Procellaria</i>.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 4. <i>Pelecano&iuml;dinae.</i>&ndash;These Diving-Petrels include <i>Pelecano&iuml;des
  urinatrix</i>, of the vicinity of Australia, New Zealand, Cape Horn, and the Falkland Islands, a
  glossy black bird with white under parts, some grey on the sides of the neck, and grey and white
  on the scapulars; <i>P. exsul</i>, of the Southern Indian Ocean, with grey throat; and <i>P.
  garnoti</i> of Western South America, <span class="pagenum" id="page69"><span
  class="smaller">{69}</span></span>which is larger and quite white below. Of the first Darwin
  says<a id="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> that it "never leaves the quiet inland
  sounds. When disturbed it dives to a distance, and, on coming to the surface, with the same
  movement takes flight. After flying by the rapid movement of its short wings for a space in a
  straight line, it drops as if struck dead, and dives again." The egg is deposited in a small
  burrow; the note is a cackle or moan.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Fossil remains are recorded from the Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand, which are
  referred to the genera <i>Puffinus</i>, <i>Ossifraga</i>, and <i>Diomedea</i>, and probably belong
  to existing species; <i>Puffinus conradii</i> is from the American Miocene, <i>P. cyermani</i>
  from Tavolara, off Sardinia; but a much more remarkable fact is the discovery in the Suffolk Red
  Crag of portions of a distinct form, named <i>Diomedea anglica</i> by Mr. Lydekker.<a id="NtA_72"

  (PELARGOMORPHAE). ORDERS: CICONIIFORMES&ndash;ANSERIFORMES&ndash;FALCONIFORMES</span></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order V. CICONIIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The Order Ciconiiformes is a somewhat unwieldy assemblage consisting mainly of Water-birds,
  which may be classed under the Sub-Orders <span class="sc">Steganopodes</span>, <span
  class="sc">Ardeae</span>, <span class="sc">Ciconiae</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Phoenicopteri</span>. Of these the first contains the <i>Pha&euml;thontidae</i> or
  Tropic-birds, the <i>Sulidae</i> or Gannets, the <i>Phalacrocoracidae</i> or Cormorants and
  Darters, the <i>Fregatidae</i> or Frigate-birds, and the <i>Pelecanidae</i> or Pelicans; the
  second the <i>Ardeidae</i> or Herons and Bitterns, and the <i>Scopidae</i> with the Umbrette; the
  third the <i>Ciconiidae</i> or Storks and Wood-Ibises, and the <i>Ibididae</i> or true Ibises and
  Spoon-bills; while the fourth comprises the <i>Phaenicopteridae</i> or Flamingos, and the extinct
  genus <i>Palaelodus</i>, for which Dr. Gadow recognises a separate family <i>Palaelodidae</i>.
  Among these the greatest affinity to the <i>Procellariiformes</i> is exhibited by the
  <i>Steganopodes</i>, whereas the <i>Phoenicopteri</i> are so closely allied to the
  <i>Anseriformes</i> that not a few writers prefer to include them in that Order.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Steganopodes</span> are aquatic and chiefly marine birds, so far
  homogeneous in structure that the details may well be set forth in common; while in some points
  they bear a great resemblance to the <i>Cathartidae</i>.<a id="NtA_73"
  href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> Each Family contains a single genus, except the
  <i>Phalacrocoracidae</i>, where <i>Phalacrocorax</i> and <i>Plotus</i> may be considered the
  equivalents of Sub-families.</p>

  <p>The sternum is long, especially in <i>Sula</i>, while the large head and short thick neck of
  <i>Pha&euml;thon</i> and <i>Fregata</i> may be contrasted with the small head and remarkably long neck
  of <i>Phalacrocorax</i>, and still more of <i>Plotus</i>; <i>Sula</i> and <i>Pelecanus</i> being
  moderate in <span class="pagenum" id="page71"><span class="smaller">{71}</span></span>both
  respects. The bill, which is more or less compound, is long, pretty straight, and generally
  compressed: in <i>Pha&euml;thon</i> and <i>Sula</i> it is strong, conical, and pointed; in
  <i>Phalacrocorax</i> either stout with a long hooked nail, or less robust with the hook at the tip
  shorter, the sides being scabrous; in <i>Fregata</i> similar, in <i>Plotus</i> slender and
  tapering, in <i>Pelecanus</i> weak, much flattened, hooked, and scaly. The maxilla is furrowed in
  <i>Sula</i>, <i>Pelecanus</i>, and <i>Phalacrocorax</i>, with the median part concave in the
  latter, while the cutting edges of both mandibles are serrated in <i>Pha&euml;thon</i>, <i>Sula</i>,
  and <i>Plotus</i>. The legs are placed far back, especially in <i>Phalacrocorax</i>, the tibiae
  being partly bare in <i>Pha&euml;thon</i> and <i>Pelecanus</i>, but feathered in the other forms, of
  which <i>Fregata</i> has the clothing continued to the toes. The metatarsus is short, stout, and
  compressed, that of <i>Fregata</i> being extremely abbreviated, as in the Spheniscidae; it is
  entirely covered with hexagonal scales, becoming almost reticulated behind, while the toes exhibit
  distinct transverse scutes in <i>Phalacrocorax</i>, and have a similar tendency elsewhere. The
  hallux, which is somewhat elevated in <i>Pha&euml;thon</i>, is turned inwards or forwards, and is
  connected with the remaining toes by full webs, except in <i>Fregata</i>, where the membranes are
  excised to about half their extent; this unique "Steganopodous" foot giving the name to the whole
  group. The stout curved claws&ndash;weaker in <i>Fregata</i>&ndash;are of medium length, that of
  the middle digit being serrated on the inner side in the last named, <i>Sula</i>, and
  <i>Phalacrocorax</i>. The wings are long and pointed, reaching their maximum in <i>Fregata</i>,
  their minimum in <i>Phalacrocorax</i>, and having a very ample spread in <i>Sula</i> and
  <i>Pelecanus</i>. There are eleven primaries, and from fifteen to twenty-nine incurved
  secondaries, which may even exceed the former. In <i>Pelecanus</i> the short, broad, roundish tail
  consists of from eighteen to twenty-four soft acute rectrices, but in the remaining genera the
  feathers are strong and stiff, being particularly rigid in <i>Phalacrocorax</i> and <i>Plotus</i>:
  <i>Pha&euml;thon</i> has sixteen, which are moderate and graduated, with a long filiform median pair in
  the adult; <i>Sula</i> and <i>Phalacrocorax</i> from twelve to fourteen in a more or less
  wedge-shaped formation; <i>Fregata</i> twelve, arranged in a fork; while <i>Plotus</i> has the
  same number, forming a fan, the webs being very broad and showing curious transverse corrugations
  in mature birds, found also on the scapulars. The tail is fairly long in the four last <span
  class="pagenum" id="page72"><span class="smaller">{72}</span></span>mentioned, except in some
  members of <i>Phalacrocorax</i>. The <span class="sans fwb">V</span>-shaped furcula ancyloses with
  the sternum in some of the Sub-Order, but <i>Fregata</i> differs from all other ornithic forms in
  the fact that the furcula also coalesces with the coracoids at its extremities, while the
  coracoids again unite firmly with the scapula, producing an almost rigid framework, considered by
  Professor Newton to be connected with the power which the bird possesses of sustaining itself
  nearly motionless in the air.<a id="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> The peculiar angular
  articulation of the long eighth cervical vertebra in <i>Plotus</i>, which causes the <span
  class="sans fwb">Z</span>-shaped "kink" in the neck, must also be noticed here.<a id="NtA_75"
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> The tongue is rudimentary; the nostrils are pervious in
  <i>Pha&euml;thon</i>, impervious elsewhere, being practically obliterated in adults; the syrinx is
  tracheo-bronchial, except in <i>Sula</i> and <i>Pelecanus</i>, where the usual muscles are
  entirely absent. The subcutaneous air-cells of <i>Sula</i> are most remarkable. The newly-hatched
  young are blind and helpless, being naked and covered with blackish skin in <i>Sula</i>,
  <i>Phalacrocorax</i>, <i>Plotus</i>, and <i>Pelecanus</i>, though they soon acquire a white downy
  coat; in <i>Pha&euml;thon</i> and <i>Fregata</i> they are similarly clothed on breaking the shell. The
  down of the adults is uniformly distributed, the aftershaft is diminutive or wanting. The gular
  sacs, horny excrescences on the beak, crests, and so forth, are noted below.</p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Phaethontidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Pha&euml;thon aethereus</i>, <i>P. flavirostris</i>, and
  <i>P. rubricauda</i> are chiefly found in the tropical regions of the south; but the first two
  species breed about as far north as the tropic of Cancer, while they frequent the West Indies, and
  occasionally stray to the Eastern United States, or even Newfoundland.<a id="NtA_76"
  href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> The third inhabits the southern seas and the Indian Ocean. All
  these Tropic- or Boatswain-birds, as they are denominated, have satin-like white
  plumage&ndash;often with a tinge of pink&ndash;varied by blackish bars or patches above, and black
  marks near the eye; the bill is red, or in <i>P. flavirostris</i> yellow, the metatarsi yellowish
  and the toes chiefly black. In <i>P. rubricauda</i> the long stiff median rectrices are dull red
  with black shafts and very narrow webs, in <i>P. flavirostris</i> they are pinkish with similar
  shafts, and in <i>P. aethereus</i> entirely white. The sexes are alike, the young being more
  irregularly marked and having no long tail-feathers.</p>

  <p>The members of this Family are true denizens of the ocean, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page73"><span class="smaller">{73}</span></span>often met with many hundred miles from land;
  they will then hover constantly about a vessel, or even alight fearlessly on the rigging. They
  traverse the air with rapid sweeping flight, accompanied by constant quick pulsations of the
  wings; at one time soaring aloft to wheel in circles, at another plunging into the water from an
  immense height, though appearing again in a moment to float upon the surface. Their gait on land
  is shuffling, while they can hardly rise from level ground; the note is a harsh croak or chatter;
  the food consists of fish, squids, and other produce of the sea. No nest is made, but a single
  reddish-brown or buff egg, with spots and frecklings of red-brown, purplish or grey, is deposited
  in a hole or crevice in a cliff, among rocks, or even in a cavity in a rotten tree, both sexes
  assisting in incubation.<a id="NtA_77" href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> The parents sit very
  closely, screaming, pecking, and snapping when disturbed; in some places they are habitually
  caught while breeding, and deprived of the long tail-feathers, which are used for decorations.</p>

  <p>Fam. II. <b>Sulidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Sula bassana</i>, the Gannet or Solan Goose, which nests at
  several stations off the west of Great Britain, in Ireland, and on the well-known Bass Rock,
  extends thence to Iceland, and down the American coast to Nova Scotia, while it strays to
  Greenland, and in winter reaches the Gulf of Mexico and northern Africa. The plumage is white,
  with a buff tinge on the head and neck, and black primaries; the bill is whitish, the feet dusky,
  and the naked skin round the eye and down the centre of the throat blackish-blue. <i>S.
  capensis</i> of South Africa and <i>S. serrator</i> of Australia are similar to the above, but the
  former has the rectrices black, the latter the four median feathers blackish-brown.</p>

  <p>The remaining species, often called "Boobies," have the whole lower jaw and throat bare. Of
  these <i>S. cyanops</i>, common in the South Pacific and ranging through the intertropical seas to
  the Bahamas in summer, is white with sooty-brown remiges, the wing-coverts and the lateral portion
  of the tail being partly of the same colour; the bill is yellow, the feet are reddish, and the
  naked parts bluish. <i>S. leucogaster</i>, extending from tropical and sub-tropical America over
  the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans,<a id="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> has the
  upper parts and chest brown, the remaining lower surface, and occasionally the head and neck,
  white; the bill is yellow, the feet are greenish or yellowish, the bare skin is tinged with red or
  yellow. <i>S. piscator</i>, also of the intertropical seas, resembles <i>S. bassana</i>, but has
  slate-grey wing-quills, purplish-grey bill, reddish feet and naked parts. <i>S. variegata</i>, of
  the shores of Chili and Peru, is dark grey-brown with white head, neck, and under parts, and white
  markings above. <i>S. abbotti</i>, of Assumption Island, north of Madagascar, is allied to <i>S.
  cyanops</i>. In this Family the sexes are alike, while the young are usually dusky with white
  streaks and spots; but those of <i>S. cyanops</i> are white below, and those of <i>S.
  leucogaster</i> and <i>S. piscator</i> chiefly sooty-brown, with <span class="pagenum"
  id="page75"><span class="smaller">{75}</span></span>grey head, neck, and under surface in the
  latter. It apparently requires six years to attain the full adult plumage.</p>

  <p>Gannets are oceanic birds, only frequenting the land in stormy weather; they traverse very
  great distances, and the northern species move southward in winter. The flight is easy and
  powerful, with alternate flapping and sailing motion, the head being carried in a line with the
  body and the feet drawn up. The food consists of surface-swimming fish, squids, and the like,
  while the young obtain their nutriment by thrusting their bills into those of the parents, though
  it is disgorged for them when newly hatched. The prey is chiefly captured by diving, the plunge
  being made with great velocity from a considerable height and the body being submerged for several
  seconds; on coming to the surface the bird generally remains quiescent for a short period before
  again taking to the air, but occasionally swims for a longer period. When diving the wings are
  kept open until the last moment, and are then quickly closed. Gannets find the same difficulty in
  rising from a level spot as do Tropic-birds, and are less prone to perch than many other
  sea-birds. The note is a hoarse reiterated sound or, less commonly, a plaintive cry, much noise
  being often made by the large colonies when breeding. The nest is a mass of sea-weed and grass,
  placed on a ledge of some high cliff, on the top of a stack, or even on a low tree; while the
  eggs&ndash;never more than two in number&ndash;are occasionally deposited on the bare sandy beach,
  and are greenish-blue, thickly coated with a white chalky substance, which soon becomes soiled.
  Incubation lasts about six weeks. The adults, especially in the case of the Boobies, are often
  absurdly fearless on land, while the female, when on the nest, grunts at an intruder, and pecks or
  bites sharply. They are frequently caught on shipboard by fixing bits of fish on floating pieces
  of wood, in which the beak is transfixed by the violence of the plunge; they do not, however,

  eating.</p>

  <p>Fam. III. <b>Phalacrocoracidae.</b>&ndash;The genus <i>Phalacrocorax</i> includes the
  Cormorants and Shags, birds of similar coloration, which differ chiefly in the brilliancy of their
  metallic hues and the proportion of white to black or brown in the plumage, the following examples
  giving a fair idea of the whole.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>P. carbo</i>, the Common Cormorant, with fourteen rectrices, has the head and neck glossy
  blue-black, interspersed with white hair-like feathers, the remaining upper parts bronzy-black,
  the throat white, the bill and feet grey-black. In spring a slight crest adorns the occiput and
  white patches appear on the thighs. In common with its congeners this species has naked lores,
  orbital and gular regions, which are here of a yellow colour, becoming redder below the eye; the
  iris is emerald-green. The skin of the throat is dilatable and forms a pouch for food. It breeds
  on most of the British coasts, except between the Humber and the Thames, and occasionally inland;
  while it ranges to Greenland northwards, and thence down the Atlantic to New Jersey in the west,
  and to North and even South Africa on the east, as well as through Europe and Asia. The Australian
  and New Zealand <i>P. novae hollandiae</i> is doubtfully distinct. <i>P. dilophus</i>, of which
  several forms occur on the shores and in the interior of North America as far south as Mexico, is
  not unlike <i>P. carbo</i>, but has a tuft of long narrow recurved plumes on each side of the
  crown in the nuptial dress, which are black, white, or particoloured according to the locality.
  The bare loral region and gular sac are orange, and no white is visible on the throat or flanks.
  The splendid <i>P. pelagicus</i>, on the contrary, has white flank-patches in addition to white
  filaments on the neck and rump, the head and <span class="pagenum" id="page77"><span
  class="smaller">{77}</span></span>neck are violet-black, and a bronzy-purple tinge extends thence
  to the wings, the naked areas being brownish-red. It ranges from Kamtschatka to Western Mexico,
  and even winters in North Japan. <i>P. urile</i>, of the extreme north of the Pacific, is very
  similar, but has the gular pouch bluish with red hinder margin, the lores, orbits, and an
  additional strip of bare skin on the forehead being orange. <i>P. perspicillatus</i>, of Bering
  Island, now considered extinct, is another close ally, in which the filamentous feathers are
  yellowish and the orbits white. <i>P. graculus</i>, the Green Cormorant or Shag, breeding in
  Britain chiefly on the western side, and occurring rarely on our inland waters, is found in many
  places along the coasts of West Europe to Morocco and the Mediterranean; it is dark green with
  black remiges and twelve black rectrices, and metallic hues on the head, neck, and under surface,
  the irides being green and the bill and feet black, as are the naked regions, which are spotted
  with yellow. In spring a recurved crest overhangs the forehead. <i>P. lucidus</i>, of South, East,
  and apparently West Africa, differs from the last in having a brown head and nape, and grey tints
  on the mantle and tail, while the chin and most of the lower parts are white. <i>P. africanus</i>
  occupies South and East Africa. <i>P. varius</i>, of New Zealand, is greenish-black above with
  grey middles to the dorsal feathers, white cheeks and under surface; the bill is horn-coloured,
  the feet black, the orbits bluish, the gular skin yellow, with an orange spot before each eye.
  <i>P. carunculatus</i>, of New Zealand, has, according to Sir W. L. Buller,<a id="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> no crest and a white band on the back, but otherwise resembles
  the crested <i>P. onslowi</i> of the Chatham Islands, and <i>P. imperialis</i> of Chili and
  Patagonia,<a id="NtA_80" href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> two fine iridescent species with the
  under surface and an alar bar white, the bare papillose skin in front of the eyes, orange-red, and
  the bill and feet brownish. <i>P. featherstoni</i> of the Chatham Islands, which is remarkable for
  possessing both an occipital and a frontal crest, is greenish-black and brown above with white
  filoplumes on the nape, and greyish-white below; the beak being dark brown, the feet
  orange-yellow, and the naked parts bluish. Similar tufts are met with in <i>P. punctatus</i> of
  New Zealand, wherein the upper plumage is mainly brown with terminal black spots on the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page78"><span class="smaller">{78}</span></span>feathers, the thighs show a
  few white markings, and a broad white stripe reaches from above the eye down each side of the
  neck, where the coat is somewhat elongated and silky. <i>P. pygmaeus</i>, the Pigmy Cormorant,
  which breeds across South-East Europe and South Asia to Java and Borneo, as well as in North
  Africa, is greenish-black with greyer mantle, reddish-brown head and neck, and small white spots
  on the lower surface, the naked parts being black. The sexes in <i>Phalacrocorax</i> are alike, or
  nearly so. The young are browner above&ndash;with little of the characteristic gloss&ndash;and
  brown, or white mottled with brown below, the bill and irides often differing in colour from those
  of the adult.</p>

  <p>The members of this family as a rule frequent salt water, yet not uncommonly breed on inland
  lakes and swamps, especially in the proximity of trees; they are often to be seen in companies,
  and are decidedly shy and cautious in most cases. The heavy flight is strong, steady, and rapid,
  bearing a certain resemblance to that of the Duck-tribe, while the birds experience considerable
  difficulty in starting, and laboriously flap their wings until fairly launched in the air, when
  they rise to some height, or skim the waves, as fancy dictates. They swim and dive to perfection,
  remaining a long time submerged, and indulging in many a turn and twist as they pursue their
  slippery prey, both wings and feet lending their aid to the performance. Ordinarily a spring
  precedes the plunge from the surface, but in presence of danger they disappear more quietly.
  Though the gait on land is an awkward waddle, Cormorants perch with ease on rocks, posts, and
  limbs of trees, where their upright posture gives them the appearance of black bottles or objects
  hung out to dry; they are stated, moreover, to be able to cling to the face of a cliff, and
  certainly can climb among thick vegetation, as in the case of <i>P. pygmaeus</i>. Not unfrequently
  they roost in trees, with the head drawn back upon the shoulders. The food, normally of fish, is
  varied by crustaceans, or even frogs and newts; the young are fed by regurgitation, and, when old
  enough, thrust their heads into their parents' bills to help themselves.<a id="NtA_81"
  href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> The note, comparatively seldom heard, is a harsh guttural croak,
  while the female hisses during incubation, in which she is said to be assisted by the male. The
  nest, placed <span class="pagenum" id="page79"><span class="smaller">{79}</span></span>in caves,
  on ledges of cliffs, tops of stacks, or low islands, and less commonly on trees, bushes or reeds,
  is a mass of sticks, grass, seaweed, rushes and the like, according to situation; the smaller
  species constructing a slighter platform when the trees are chosen, and a lining of green leaves
  being occasionally added. Early in spring colonies, often of very large dimensions, are formed by
  many&ndash;but not all&ndash;of the species for breeding purposes, the stench from the remains of
  decaying fish at such spots being decidedly unpleasant. Incubation lasts about four weeks.
  Cormorants were of old used in England for catching fish, and this has been a regular business
  from time immemorial in China and Japan; but with us it is a mere sport, the chief exponent of
  which is now Captain F. H. Salvin, whose chapters on "Fishing with Cormorants" will be read with
  pleasure by those interested in the subject.<a id="NtA_82" href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> The
  bird rises to the surface to swallow its prey, but a strap round the neck allows it to dispose of
  the smallest only of its captures, while it is forced by its master to disgorge the remainder
  before it is rewarded with a portion of the catch.</p>

  <p><i>Plotus anhinga</i>, the Snake-bird or Darter of tropical and sub-tropical America, ranging
  northwards to West Mexico and South Carolina, is glossy greenish-black with beautiful silvery-grey
  markings on the scapulars and wing-coverts, a broad brown tip to the tail, which becomes white
  terminally, and long whitish hair-like feathers on the sides of the occiput and neck, merging into
  a black mane on the nape. The filoplumes are absent in winter, and are inconspicuous in the
  female, which differs, moreover, in having a grey-buff head, neck, and breast, the latter being
  divided from the belly by a chestnut band. The young resemble the mother-bird, but are duller and
  lack the chestnut tint. The peculiar long thin neck and corrugated rectrices have been mentioned
  above; the plumage is unusually close, and is chiefly composed of small soft feathers of very
  uniform distribution; the lores, orbits, chin, and throat are naked, the two former being
  apparently greenish, and the latter, which is moderately dilatable, orange. The bill is olive
  above and yellow below, the feet mainly olive with yellow webs. Three other species are
  recognised, but the variability in the amount of rufous in all makes their validity somewhat
  questionable. They are <i>P. novae hollandiae</i> of Australia, New Zealand, and New Guinea, with
  a <span class="pagenum" id="page80"><span class="smaller">{80}</span></span>white stripe on the
  sides of the head and a white border to the gular sac; the almost identical <i>P. melanogaster</i>
  of the Indian Region, extending to Celebes; and <i>P. levaillanti</i> of the Ethiopian
  Region&ndash;described also from Antioch as <i>P. chantrii</i>&ndash;which has a rufous crown,
  buff throat, and chestnut greater wing-coverts.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Darters cannot be classed as marine birds, though they frequent inlets of the sea as well as
  lakes and rivers, where they sun themselves with outspread wings on some stump, rock, tree, or
  even tuft of rushes, while seldom admitting of a near approach. When disturbed, they circle in the
  air with the neck drawn back upon the shoulders, as do the Pelicans; but the flight is laboured,
  and they are much more at their ease in water, where they swim very low, exposing only the head
  and neck, or even the bill, if danger threatens, and having a very snake-like appearance, as they
  <span class="pagenum" id="page81"><span class="smaller">{81}</span></span>sway gracefully from
  side to side in their endeavours to keep the intruder in view. Hardly a ripple follows the
  prolonged dive, while below the surface the wings are but slightly used, the tail being often
  expanded, and the feet acting as powerful paddles. On reappearance a fish is generally to be seen
  grasped in the bill or transfixed by it, the peculiar mechanism of the vertebrae of the neck
  allowing the head to be darted forward at a moment's notice for the capture;<a id="NtA_83"
  href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> subsequently the prey is jerked up into the air, cleverly caught
  and swallowed. The food, which seldom varies, is sometimes obtained by the bird standing with the
  body immersed to waylay the passing shoals; but if Gould is correct in adding frogs, newts, and
  aquatic insects to the diet, these must be procured very differently. The nest, generally situated
  over water, is a flat or concave fabric of sticks, lined as a rule with leaves, moss, or roots,
  and often used for several years in succession. High trees or bushes are indifferently chosen, and
  colonies are usually, but not invariably, formed, several pairs being accustomed to breed in
  proximity on the branches. The two to five eggs are greenish-blue with chalky incrustation, like
  those of Cormorants, though smaller and more delicate. The note is short and hoarse. Both sexes
  are said to incubate, and to regurgitate food for the young.<a id="NtA_84"
  href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> Jerdon says that the scapulars of the Indian Darter were royal
  badges among the Khasias. It is tamed by boatmen in Bengal.</p>

  <p>Fam. IV. <b>Fregatidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Fregata aquila</i>, the Frigate- or Man-of-War-Bird, the
  latter of which names is sometimes transferred to the Albatroses and smaller Skuas, is met with
  throughout the tropical regions, and has even strayed as far north as Nova Scotia. It is
  blackish-brown with green and purple reflexions; the bill is bluish, the feet are black, the
  orbits, lores, and pouch&ndash;inflated in flight&ndash;scarlet. The female is browner above and
  white below, with pinkish feet and no perceptible pouch; while the young resemble her, but shew
  some white on the head and neck. <i>F. minor</i>, found from Madagascar to Papuasia and North
  Australia, but seldom beyond these limits, is smaller, with less purple gloss and a white mark on
  each flank.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These birds are usually seen singly or in pairs, and are pre-eminently oceanic, seldom coming
  to land except near the breeding quarters, where they roost on the trees; the normal flight is
  extremely rapid, graceful, and long-sustained, with sudden deviations from the course, but they
  often soar until they appear mere specks in the sky, descending thence with great abruptness. At
  times they float aloft with little apparent movement of the wide-spread wings, alternately opening
  and shutting the forked tail and inclining the head from side to side, while in hurricanes they
  fly low before the gale. At rare intervals they are found sitting asleep upon the shore. Flocks
  frequently pursue the surface-swimming fish, constituting their main aliment, which are seized
  almost without ruffling the water; squids, small crabs, flying fish, and young turtles being also
  eaten. To see a Frigate-bird plunge, however, is no uncommon occurrence, and the habit of forcing
  Terns, Boobies, and the like to disgorge their prey, which is caught before it reaches the waves,
  must not be forgotten.<a id="NtA_85" href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> If secured in an awkward
  position the captures are tossed up in the air, caught again and swallowed. The note, a harsh
  croak or cackle, is seldom heard. The nest of small sticks, which the birds tear off upon the
  wing, is generally in trees or bushes, though occasionally on the ground or on a bare rock; it is
  often <span class="pagenum" id="page83"><span class="smaller">{83}</span></span>very slight, and
  almost invariably contains one egg, resembling that of the Cormorant. The young are fed by
  regurgitation, and both sexes are said to incubate, sitting very closely, and merely snapping at
  an intruder. The feathers are used for head-dresses in the Pacific Islands.</p>

  <p>Fam. V. <b>Pelecanidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Pelecanus onocrotalus</i>, the Pelican, of South-East
  Europe, North-East and South-West Africa, reported also from France, Germany, and Denmark, is
  white with a rosy or salmon tinge, the primaries being black, and the moderate occipital crest and
  stiff elongated feathers of the lower fore-neck washed with yellow. The lores and orbits are
  naked, while an enormous dilatable semi-transparent pouch fills the space between the branches of
  the lower jaw. According to Mr. Dresser,<a id="NtA_86" href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> these
  parts and a fleshy knob appearing on the forehead in spring are yellow, the bill is bluish-grey
  with pink sides marked with red, and the feet are also pink. These colours, however, may vary with
  the season. In this species, and to a certain extent in <i>P. erythrorhynchus</i>, the feathering
  on the forehead ends in a point, but elsewhere is more or less concave anteriorly. Closely allied
  forms of doubtful validity are <i>P. minor</i>, with a somewhat similar range, <i>P. sharpii</i>
  of West Africa, and <i>P. mitratus</i> of South Africa. <i>P. crispus</i>, occupying a slightly
  more eastern area than <i>P. onocrotalus</i>, is distinguished from it by the curled filamentous
  plumes which overhang the sides of the head, the lack of rosy tints, and the flesh-coloured
  orbits. <i>P. erythrorhynchus</i> of temperate North America, found in winter down to Guatemala,
  resembles the last-named, but has a still more pendent nuptial crest, and in the breeding season
  develops a curious triangular horny excrescence on the middle of the culmen, shed about May. The
  chest and wing-coverts show a little yellow, the bill and naked parts are reddish, the feet
  orange-red, while the lower jaw is densely feathered. <i>P. rufescens</i> of the Ethiopian Region,
  apparently identical with <i>P. philippensis</i> of South Asia, is white, with black primaries,
  and a grey shade on the secondaries, tail, crested head, or even lower surface; the back is
  rose-coloured; the stiff feathers on the fore-neck, the bill and pouch, are yellowish, with
  vertical red lines on the latter. The remainder of the bare skin is flesh-coloured, and the feet
  are pink. <i>P. fuscus</i> of the warmer coasts of North America, the range of which south of
  Panama is uncertain, and depends upon the <span class="pagenum" id="page84"><span
  class="smaller">{84}</span></span>validity of <i>P. molinae</i> of Peru and Chili, has a white or
  occasionally yellowish head, silvery-grey upper parts with dusky streaks, and browner under parts.
  The crested nape is chestnut, varying to blackish; the bill and loral region are grey or bluish,
  the dark-tipped maxilla being spotted with red; the pouch is red, or dusky, like the feet; the
  bare orbits are blue. <i>P. conspicillatus</i> of Australia and Southern New Guinea is white, with
  black wings and tail and a yellow wash on the chest; the bill, feet, and naked parts are
  yellowish-white, with a blue tinge on the two first and a similarly coloured ring round the
  orbits, which are divided by a feathered space from the lores. In this Family the sexes are
  similar; the young being usually crestless, and of a brown hue, with yellowish or dusky pouch and
  occasionally white mottlings.</p>

  <p>Pelicans inhabit not only tidal waters, but also swampy districts and inland lakes, traversing
  in some cases vast distances on migration, and being usually found in company. Though <span
  class="pagenum" id="page85"><span class="smaller">{85}</span></span>heavy, and of enormous size,
  they fly buoyantly and swiftly, with the neck drawn in upon the shoulders and the feet extended
  behind; while at times they soar in spiral fashion to great altitudes, and circle around with
  alternate flapping and sailing movements. On land the gait is awkward and waddling, and great
  difficulty is experienced in rising; but some species habitually perch, and all are very
  proficient in the water, swimming, diving, or plunging from great heights, according to their
  various customs. The food consists almost entirely of moderate-sized fish taken by the bird either
  by pouncing down sharply from above, or, when quiescent on the surface, by immersing the head or
  disappearing totally from sight with a somersault. The prey is chiefly sought in shallows, and is
  retained in the pouch until the birds return to land, or until it is transferred half-macerated to
  the young; occasionally the adults may be seen gorged after feeding, sitting upon the water or
  basking in the rays of the sun. The deep loud note is very seldom heard. Pelicans usually breed in
  colonies in wild districts, though occasionally near villages,<a id="NtA_87"
  href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> the nest, when on the branches of trees, being of sticks with a
  lining of twigs or roots, as in <i>P. philippensis</i>; at other times it is a rough mound of
  gravel and rubbish on the ground with a slight cavity above, as is often the case in the American
  species, which also lay in mere depressions in the sand, the localities chosen being generally
  islands in lakes or rivers; the European forms amass a pile of reeds and grasses among aquatic
  herbage in like places or swamps, while the Australian constructs a large fabric of sticks and
  water-plants in similar spots or on the summits of rocky islets. The eggs, varying from one to
  five, but ordinarily two or three in number, are white or bluish-white with a chalky incrustation,
  soon becoming soiled and often stained with blood. The parents are as a rule shy and easily scared
  from the nest, where the smell from the refuse fish and excrement is in many cases intolerable.
  Incubation lasts about four weeks. Bands of these birds sometimes unite to systematically beat the
  water for their prey, stowing it in the distensible pouch. In India they are used&ndash;frequently
  with the eyes sewn up&ndash;to decoy fish by their oily secretions,<a id="NtA_88"
  href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> and in various countries they are slaughtered for the sake of
  the latter. The fable of the young being fed with blood from the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page86"><span class="smaller">{86}</span></span>female's breast may have arisen from confusion
  of the Pelican with the Flamingo, which ejects a blood-like liquid from its mouth.<a id="NtA_89"
  href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of fossil Steganopodes we have <i>Pha&euml;thon</i> from the Pliocene of India; three species of
  <i>Pelecanus</i> from the same formation of the Siwalik hills, one from the Miocene of Bavaria,
  one from that of Allier in France, and one from the Queensland drifts; while in England that genus
  is recorded, on the strength of the humerus, radius, and ulna from the Plistocene of Norfolk and
  from the Isle of Ely. <i>Sula</i> has occurred in the Miocene of Carolina, and of Auvergne and
  Ronzon in France; the giant <i>Pelagornis</i>&ndash;akin to <i>Sula</i> and <i>Pelecanus</i>, but
  perhaps indicating a distinct family&ndash;has also been found in the Miocene near Bordeaux; and
  <i>Argillornis</i>, related to <i>Sula</i>, in the Lower Eocene (London Clay) of England. From the
  same beds we have the remarkable <i>Odontopteryx toliapica</i>, with coarsely serrated edges to
  the jaws; <i>Phalacrocorax</i> has been met with in the North American Pliocene, the same strata
  of the Siwalik hills, the Miocene of Allier and the Orl&eacute;annais in France, and the Pampean of
  Argentina, <i>Actiornis anglicus</i> of Lydekker being a close ally from the Hampshire Eocene;
  <i>Plotus nanus</i> has been described from the Mare aux Songes in Mauritius and from Central
  Madagascar, <i>P. parvus</i> from Queensland.</p>

  <p>The Sub-Order <span class="sc">Ardeae</span> contains the Families <i>Ardeidae</i> and
  <i>Scopidae</i>, in which the body is often compressed, the head and eyes are large, and the neck
  is long. Most members of the former have a long, straight, sharp bill with rounded culmen and
  flattened sides, the edges being commonly serrated and the maxilla notched; it may be
  comparatively small, as in <i>Zebrilus</i>, but is usually stout, and in <i>Cancroma</i> is
  extraordinarily broad and depressed, with prominent keel and somewhat dilatable skin beneath, the
  form resembling that of an inverted boat. <i>Balaeniceps</i> (Fig. 27) has a huge beak, which is
  not only flattened and swollen, but has a ridge on the culmen terminating in a hook, the maxilla
  having an undulating outline above and following the strong upward curve of the mandible below,
  while its sides are grooved. So peculiar, indeed, is this bird that it might well stand alone in a
  Sub-family <i>Balaenicipitinae</i>, as opposed to the <i>Ardeinae</i>, if not referred to the
  Storks, where many writers have placed it. In <i>Scopus</i> the bill is acute, keeled, greatly
  compressed, and laterally grooved, with a small hook at the tip. The tibia is usually bare <span
  class="pagenum" id="page87"><span class="smaller">{87}</span></span>below, though occasionally
  feathered, as in <i>Ardetta</i> and <i>Zebrilus</i>; the metatarsus being remarkably long, except
  in such forms as <i>Nycticorax</i>, <i>Botaurus</i>, and <i>Ardetta</i>. The latter member is
  covered anteriorly with transverse or hexagonal scales, which become smaller or reticulated
  behind, and show a decided tendency to fusion in many cases. The toes are long, with a distinct
  web between the middle and outer; the claws are generally short and curved, though elongated,
  slender, and nearly straight in <i>Botaurus</i> and <i>Ardetta</i>; that of the middle digit being
  toothed on the inner side, save in <i>Balaeniceps</i>. The wing is somewhat rounded, yet long, and
  has eleven primaries&ndash;reduced to ten in <i>Scopus</i>&ndash;and from eleven to eighteen
  secondaries; the fairly even tail is short or moderate, with from ten to twelve broad stiffish
  feathers, except in <i>Botaurus</i> and <i>Ardetta</i>, where the ten rectrices are soft and
  abbreviated. The tongue is usually long and pointed, but in <i>Cancroma</i>, <i>Balaeniceps</i>,
  and <i>Scopus</i> it is very short; the lores and orbits are naked, save in <i>Scopus</i>, as is
  the malar region in <i>Tigrornis</i> and <i>Tigrisoma</i>, while the last at times has the throat
  bare, or merely feathered centrally. The nostrils are impervious only in <i>Cancroma</i> and
  <i>Balaeniceps</i>. The nestlings are uniformly covered with sparse hair-like down. The state of
  the chick is unrecorded in <i>Balaeniceps</i> and <i>Scopus</i>. The furcula is generally <span
  class="sans fwb">V</span>-shaped, the syrinx is tracheo-bronchial, and an aftershaft is present,
  the latter and the syringeal muscles being much reduced in <i>Balaeniceps</i>. Crests and
  decorative plumes are common, as will be seen below.</p>

  <p>Of especial importance are the large, thick, "powder-down patches," or greasy yellow spaces
  covered with tufts of grey or black filaments, disintegrating into bluish or whitish powder.
  <i>Balaeniceps</i> has a big pair on the lower back, <i>Botaurus</i> and <i>Ardetta</i> an
  additional couple on the breast, and the remainder of the Ardeidae two more on the abdomen, except
  <i>Cancroma</i> which possesses still another pair on the upper back. In <i>Scopus</i> they are
  absent. The use is uncertain, and the occurrence quite irregular.</p>

  <p>Fam. VI. <b>Ardeidae.</b>&ndash;There are few persons in Britain who are not to some extent
  acquainted with the habits of the Common Heron or Hern, for it may be seen on the coast as well as
  on inland waters, and now breeds in more localities than formerly, though in smaller numbers;
  while of the remainder of the Family the Bitterns alone differ conspicuously in their mode of
  life. Herons are shy, solitary birds, frequenting lakes, fens, and rivers, where they <span
  class="pagenum" id="page88"><span class="smaller">{88}</span></span>may often be seen standing
  ankle-deep in the water, and watching with untiring patience for the prey which never seems to
  satisfy their appetite. They rarely swim and walk but little. The majority breed in large
  colonies; but Bitterns (<i>Botaurus</i>), Little Bitterns (<i>Ardetta</i>), and Green Herons
  (<i>Butorides</i>) are notable exceptions, being, moreover, skulking and nocturnal in habit, and
  agreeing in the latter respect with Night-Herons (<i>Nycticorax</i>). The mud-flats commonly found
  on sandy shores provide excellent feeding ground, and thence old and young may be seen winging
  their way at considerable altitudes with leisurely flapping flight&ndash;rarely
  accelerated&ndash;to roost at night on the customary trees or rocks. Bitterns and their nearest
  allies are seldom seen far from marshes, flying noiselessly with laboured action and at a
  comparatively slow pace; they are, however, adepts at running or climbing among the water-plants,
  and perch with ease; while they often assume an upright position with the bill vertical, and
  thereby closely resemble the surrounding reeds, the deception being occasionally enhanced by the
  bird turning as if on a pivot and facing the spectator constantly.<a id="NtA_90"
  href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> Herons fly with the head drawn back, therein differing from the
  rest of the Order, and in some cases roost or bask in the sun on one leg; they are usually
  graceful and stately, the beautiful Egrets moving more easily on land than their kindred, and
  being somewhat less wary. The voice is a harsh croak or guttural sound, that of the Night-Heron
  verging upon a quack; while the Bitterns, besides the common cry, utter a booming or bellowing
  note in the breeding season, generally heard at night or early in the morning, the method of
  production of which is not at present quite clear. <i>Ardetta</i> gives vent to a somewhat similar
  but weaker boom or grunt, and most species are noisy at the nest, hissing or screaming sharply.
  The diet consists largely of fish, but is varied by small mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians,
  grasshoppers and other insects, molluscs, crustaceans, and worms, the digestion being very rapid
  and the birds seldom gorged. In the shallows the majority of the family stand motionless, and
  spear their prey with the beak as it passes, occasionally mauling it before swallowing; but some
  move from place to place, while the Buff-backed Heron (<i>Ardea bubulcus</i>) habitually picks
  insects from the backs or sides of the cattle. The nest, commonly situated <span class="pagenum"
  id="page89"><span class="smaller">{89}</span></span>on lofty trees, though frequently on low
  bushes, ivy-covered cliffs, flat rocks, or reeds and herbage in swamps, is often a large fabric of
  sticks without lining or with a slight bedding of grass, leaves, and the like, but may be a mere
  mass of rushes and flags; the tree-building forms at times resorting to the ground and <i>vice
  vers&acirc;</i>. Bitterns generally crush down the aquatic vegetation and add softer materials on this
  substructure, depositing four or five olive-drab eggs; <i>Ardetta</i> in some cases does the same,
  but the eggs are bluish- or greenish-white; whereas those of the Herons proper are of a greenish-
  or whitish-blue colour of varying depth, and exceptionally amount to six or seven.
  <i>Butorides</i> not uncommonly lays only two. If the first set is removed a second is often
  produced after a short interval; but the young remain long in the nest. Incubation lasts from
  sixteen to thirty days. Herons were of old protected by law, as affording an excellent quarry for
  Falcons, while the flesh was highly esteemed; when wounded, however, they must be carefully
  approached, as they use the bill with deadly effect, and aim at the captor's eye. In India they
  are used as decoy-birds with the eyes sewn up.</p>

  <p>The following will sufficiently shew the coloration; the largest species is <i>Ardea
  goliath</i>; <i>Ardetta</i> furnishes the smallest forms.</p>

  <p><i>Botaurus stellaris</i>, the Bittern, which bred so lately as 1868 in Norfolk, and occurs
  throughout the warmer parts of the Palaearctic and the whole of the Ethiopian Region, is buff,
  with black bars above and streaks below, black crown, nape, and stripes down the side of the neck,
  and chestnut bands on the primaries. <i>B. lentiginosus</i>, distinguished by the nearly uniform
  brown primaries, is rarely found in Britain, but inhabits North America, probably meeting about
  Nicaragua with <i>B. pinnatus</i> of tropical South America, which lacks the neck-stripes; while
  <i>B. poeciloptilus</i> of the Australian Region has much of the back brown. The neck-feathers in
  these birds form an elongated ruff. <i>Ardetta minuta</i> of Central and Southern Europe, Western
  Asia, and the northern half of Africa, formerly known to have bred in England, is greenish-black,
  with buff neck, wing-coverts, and under surface, the latter slightly streaked with dusky. These
  streaks are more decided in other species, which are often greyer, browner, or more ruddy above;
  <i>A. cinnamomea</i> of the Indian Region is almost entirely rufous, while all have a slight
  head-tuft. A fuller crest marks <i>Zebrilus pumilus</i> of northern South America, wherein <span
  class="pagenum" id="page90"><span class="smaller">{90}</span></span>the upper parts are black with
  fulvous undulations, and the lower parts correspondingly mottled. The "Tiger-Bitterns"
  (<i>Tigrisoma</i>) extend from Central America to North Argentina, the four or five forms varying
  chiefly in the amount of naked skin on the throat. <i>T. brasiliense</i> is blackish with rusty
  vermiculations above, and reddish-grey below, the head being mainly chestnut, and the tips of the
  remiges and spots on the breast white. <i>Tigrornis leucolophus</i> of West Africa has a narrow
  white crest, the neck-feathers hanging loosely down, as in <i>Tigrisoma</i>. <i>Zonerodius
  heliosylus</i> of New Guinea is black above with fulvous bands, and has white bars on the wing;
  the rump and fore-neck are white with dusky markings, the lower parts yellowish-white. The genus
  <i>Butorides</i>, connecting the Bitterns and the Herons, exhibits somewhat elongated plumes on
  the crown, fore-neck, and scapular region. These small birds, variegated with glossy green, black,
  grey, and chestnut, and often streaked with white, occur chiefly in the Neotropical and Australian
  Regions, though <i>B. virescens</i> at least inhabits North America and <i>B. atricapilla</i> the
  Ethiopian countries.</p>

  <p><i>Nycticorax</i> (Night-Heron) is an almost cosmopolitan genus, remarkable for the long linear
  blackish or white occipital feathers, from two to ten in number, apparently lost for a time after
  breeding. In our occasional visitor, <i>N. griseus</i>, of the Palaearctic, Indian, and Ethiopian
  Regions, and the barely separable <i>N. naevius</i> of America, the colour is greenish-black, with
  grey neck, rump, wings, and tail, white cheeks and lower parts. <i>N. leuconotus</i> of the
  Ethiopian Region has the neck rufous, the back white, and the under surface spotted with dusky;
  <i>N.</i> (<i>Pilerodius</i>) <i>pileatus</i> of tropical South America is white with black crown;
  <i>N.</i> (<i>Nycterodius</i>) <i>violaceus</i> of the same districts, which extends to the United
  States, is plumbeous, with yellowish-white crown and black stripes above, the scapulars being
  somewhat decomposed; <i>N. pauper</i>, confined to the Galapagos, is very similar; <i>N.</i>
  (<i>Syrigma</i>) <i>sibilatrix</i> of South Brazil, Chili, and Argentina, is grey, with blackish
  head and remiges, rufous markings on the face and wing-coverts, and yellowish-white breast;
  <i>N.</i> (<i>Gorsachius</i>) <i>goisagi</i>, ranging from India and the Malay countries to Japan,
  is red-brown, with buff and white lower parts, the whole plumage being marked with dusky; while
  <i>N. caledonicus</i> of the Australian Region has the upper parts rich buff, the lower parts
  white, and only the head black. <i>Cancroma cochlearia</i>, the Boat-billed Night-Heron of South
  <span class="pagenum" id="page91"><span class="smaller">{91}</span></span>America, is blue-grey
  with white on the forehead and neck; the head, crest, and flanks being black, and the belly
  cinnamon. <i>C. zeledoni</i> of Central America differs in its reddish fore-neck.</p>

  <p><i>Ardea</i>, another world-wide genus, may be subdivided as below if desired,<a id="NtA_91"
  href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> but the supposed generic characters are hardly satisfactory.
  <i>A.</i> (<i>Buphus</i>) <i>bubulcus</i>, the Buff-backed Heron of South Europe, Africa, and Asia
  to the Caspian, is white, with buff crown and nape, and elongated occipital, scapular, and jugular
  plumes of the same colour, developed in the breeding season; <i>A. coromanda</i>, with orange
  head, neck, and scapulars, replacing it from the Caspian eastward and reaching Japan. The former
  has once visited Britain, while <i>A.</i> (<i>Ardeola</i>) <i>ralloides</i>, the Squacco Heron,
  has done so frequently. This bird, which ranges from the Canaries and Central Europe to South
  Africa and Persia, is warm buff, with white wings, tail, breast, and belly, the darker back
  possessing long hair-like plumes which cover the tail, the jugulars being buff, and the head
  graced by a tuft of long white feathers, margined with black. <i>A.</i> (<i>Lepterodius</i>)
  <i>gularis</i> of tropical Africa and Madagascar, and <i>A. asha</i>, extending from the Persian
  Gulf to India, are dusky-slate with white throat, and have moderate scapular and pectoral plumes,
  with a nuptial crest. <i>A.</i> (<i>Demiegretta</i>) <i>sacra</i>, ranging from Bengal to Japan,
  Australia, and the Pacific, differs in having only a white streak down the throat, <i>A. greyi</i>
  being a white phase. <i>A.</i> (<i>Melanophoyx</i>) <i>ardesiaca</i> of the Ethiopian Region is
  almost entirely slaty-black, with elongated occipital, dorsal, and jugular feathers; <i>A.</i>
  (<i>Notophoyx</i>) <i>picata</i> of Australia, New Guinea, and the Moluccas, is bluer, and nearly
  white below; while <i>A. pacifica</i> of that country is greener, with white head and rufescent
  dorsal plumes. <i>A.</i> (<i>Dichromanassa</i>) <i>rufa</i> of the warmer parts of North America
  is plumbeous, with reddish head and neck, its white phase being denominated <i>A. pealii</i>; here
  nearly all the head- and neck-feathers are elongated, and the filamentous scapulars extend beyond
  the tail. <i>A.</i> (<i>Hydranassa</i>) <i>tricolor</i>, found from the Southern United States to
  Brazil, is grey-blue, purple, rufous, and white, with shorter seasonal plumes than the preceding;
  <i>A.</i> (<i>Florida</i>) <i>caerulea</i>, with a slightly more northern range, is slaty-blue,
  with maroon head and neck, a variable amount of white when immature, and extremely long scapulars;
  while <i>A.</i> (<i>Agamia</i>) <i>agami</i> of central and northern South America is metallic
  green, with rufous and white throat, rufous belly, black cheeks and nape; the very long occipital
  and dorsal plumes being grey, as is the fore-neck, and the recurved feathers of the sides of the
  neck reddish.</p>

  <p><i>A.</i> (<i>Garzetta</i>) <i>garzetta</i>, the "Little Egret," which has strayed to Britain,
  and extends from South Europe to the whole of Africa, India, and Japan, is entirely white, with
  long filamentous scapular and moderate jugular plumes and two lengthened crest-feathers, all of
  which are said to be temporarily lost after breeding. <i>A. nigripes</i>, ranging from Java to
  Australia, is barely distinguishable, but the American representative, <i>A. candidissima</i>, has
  a large occipital tuft. <i>A.</i> (<i>Herodias</i>) <i>alba</i>, the Great White Heron, another of
  our rare visitors, extends from the middle of Europe to most of Africa, Central Asia, and the
  Burmese countries, beyond which a doubtfully distinct species, with yellower bill, reaches
  Australia and New Zealand; the American <i>A. egretta</i>, however, differs in its black legs. The
  breeding adult is white, with very long decomposed scapular and lengthened jugular plumes, but no
  crest. The most typical forms of <i>Ardea</i> are large slaty-coloured birds, varied by black,
  rufous, and white, the head being commonly darker and the lower parts striped; while two slender
  occipital plumes are, <span class="pagenum" id="page93"><span class="smaller">{93}</span></span>in
  most cases, developed in the nuptial period, and the scapular and jugular feathers are elongated,
  though not decomposed. The Common Heron (<i>A. cinerea</i>), ranging through Europe, Africa, and
  Asia, to Japan and Australia, needs no description, but the Purple Heron, <i>A.</i> (<i>Phoyx</i>)
  <i>purpurea</i>, though it often occurs in Britain, is less well known. It is grey, with black
  crown and black stripes down the sides of the buff neck, chestnut scapulars, rufous, grey, and
  black jugular plumes, and maroon breast; the range being from Central and Southern Europe to South
  Africa, China, and the Philippines. <i>A. herodias</i> of North America meets in northern South
  America the white-necked <i>A. cocoi</i>, both species resembling <i>A. cinerea</i>, but the
  former having rufous thighs and edge of the wing. The white <i>A. occidentalis</i>, of Florida and
  Cuba,<a id="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> was formerly thought to be an instance of
  dichromatism. The African <i>A. goliath</i> has the head and neck rufous and the under surface
  chiefly maroon.</p>

  <p>The sexes are usually alike; but the female has ordinarily shorter plumes, and may be duller,
  as may the young, though the stages of plumage are not yet completely worked out. White or rufous
  markings are often noticeable, especially in immature specimens of <i>Ardea</i>; there is little
  red about the head in those of <i>Dichromanassa</i>, though in <i>Hydranassa</i> the amount is
  greater than in the adult; those of <i>Florida</i> are generally very white; and, conversely,
  white <span class="pagenum" id="page94"><span class="smaller">{94}</span></span>species often shew
  grey tints in early life; while immature examples of <i>Nycticorax</i> differ entirely from their
  parents, being brown with white or buff spotting above, and white with dusky stripes below.</p>

  <p>The bill, feet, naked lores, and orbits may be reddish, bluish, green, yellow, brown, or
  black.</p>

  <p><i>Balaeniceps rex</i>, the Shoe-bill, of the White Nile, has a short crest, and is
  brownish-grey with blackish wings, tail, and feet, the bill being yellow with dusky mottlings. It
  usually forms large flocks, and frequents bushy morasses. The flight is Heron-like, and the birds
  will often settle on trees; the young run about with extended wings and clattering bills.<a
  id="NtA_93" href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> The food consists of fish, frogs, snakes, molluscs,
  and even carrion. A mere hole in the dry soil often contains the chalky white eggs, from two to
  twelve in number, but a lining of herbage is frequently added.</p>

  <p>Fam. VII. <b>Scopidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Scopus umbretta</i>, the Hammer-head, of Madagascar and a
  large part of the Ethiopian Region, is purplish-brown, with black tail-bars, wider towards the
  tip; the head exhibits a thick erectile crest, generally carried horizontally; the bill is black
  and the feet are brownish. It frequents wooded districts near water, and is usually found in
  pairs; not being very shy, except when breeding, and being more active at dusk than in the
  daytime. At night it roosts in trees. The neck is slightly curved in flight, but the feet are
  outstretched, while the gait on the ground is deliberate. The note is a harsh quack or weak
  metallic sound; the food consists of fish, reptiles, frogs, worms, molluscs, and insects captured
  in shallow water, and while feeding the birds have a curious habit of skipping round each other
  with extended wings. The nest is an enormous structure of sticks, lined with roots, grass, rushes,
  or clay, having a hole at the side, and ordinarily a flat top; it is placed in a tree, on a rocky
  ledge, or exceptionally on the ground. Three to five white eggs form the complement. Native
  imagination associates this species with witchcraft.</p>

  <p>Besides the extinct brevipennate <i>Nycticorax megacephalus</i> of Rodriguez, known to the
  first colonists, and the fossil <i>Butorides mauritianus</i> of the Mare aux Songes, this
  Sub-Order furnishes <i>Proherodius oweni</i> from the London Clay (Lower Eocene); <i>Ardea</i>
  from the Miocene of France and Germany, and the Pliocene of Oregon.</p>

  <p>Fam. VIII. <b>Ciconiidae.</b>&ndash;Of the Sub-Order <span class="sc">Ciconiae</span>, the
  first Family is that of the Storks, which have long necks and also long stout beaks, usually
  straight and fairly cylindrical, but occasionally compressed, as in <i>Leptoptilus</i>, upturned
  towards the tip, as in <i>Mycteria</i>, or decurved, as in <i>Tantalus</i>; in <i>Anastomus</i>
  there is a wide gap between the grooved mandibles, the edges of the maxilla possessing fine horny
  lamellae. Very remarkable, moreover, are the unprotected pervious nostrils, which are mere
  perforations in the bony sheath. The tibia is partly bare, while the elongated metatarsus is
  covered with hexagonal scales, becoming more reticulated behind in <i>Leptoptilus</i> and
  <i>Mycteria</i>; the partially webbed front toes and flattened claws are in most cases very
  short&ndash;though lengthened and more slender in <i>Tantalus</i>&ndash;and rest upon horny
  pads,<a id="NtA_94" href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> the hallux being slightly elevated. The
  wings are ample and fairly long, with eleven stout primaries in <i>Ciconia</i> and twelve
  elsewhere, and from fourteen to twenty-five secondaries, the inner of which are often greatly
  <span class="pagenum" id="page96"><span class="smaller">{96}</span></span>developed. The short
  tail is normally even or slightly rounded, with twelve broad feathers, but in <i>Dissura</i> it is
  deeply forked<a id="NtA_95" href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> and rigid, while the unusually stiff
  coverts extending from beneath are easily mistaken for rectrices. In <i>Leptoptilus</i> these
  elongated coverts are soft, and are the genuine "Marabou feathers." The furcula is <span
  class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the tongue rudimentary, the aftershaft present or absent, and
  there are no powder-down patches; the trachea in the male of <i>Tantalus ibis</i> has several
  intrathoracic convolutions,<a id="NtA_96" href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> while there is an
  entire want of syringeal muscles. The adults and young possess uniform down, that of the nestlings
  being greyish or whitish.</p>

  <p>Storks, though easily tamed, are naturally shy, solitary birds, which frequent wooded or open
  country on plains or hills, usually near inland waters, creeks, or salt-water lagoons; the White
  Stork and the Adjutant are, however, instances of somewhat different habits, the former showing a
  predilection for homesteads, and the latter being protected as a scavenger in some parts of India;
  while <i>Ciconia abdimii</i> is considered a "bird of blessing" by the natives of Africa. Flocks
  are occasionally seen. The flight is graceful and noiseless, but powerful and rapid, the neck and
  legs being carried in line with the body, and immense heights being often attained by soaring and
  circling movements. No difficulty is experienced in walking, and many species stalk solemnly about
  in pursuit of prey, whether in water or on dry land; not uncommonly they rest with the whole
  metatarsus upon the ground, or stand on one foot with the bill touching the breast. They are
  ordinarily quiescent during the heat of the day, and at night frequently roost in trees.
  <i>Mycteria senegalensis</i> and <i>M. indica</i> are said to dance around their mates, the former
  skipping and bowing, and the latter fluttering its extended wings, which touch those of its
  partner, while advancing the head and making a clatter with the bill.<a id="NtA_97"
  href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> Generally speaking, this is the only noise Storks produce, owing
  to the want of voice-muscles; but Adjutants are said to utter a loud grunting croak or bellow, and
  the young of <i>Ciconia nigra</i> to give vent to a guttural cry. The food consists of fish,
  reptiles, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, grasshoppers, and beetles, with small mammals, or
  even eggs and young of birds; but <i>Leptoptilus</i> is nearly omnivorous and enjoys carrion,
  including human carcases, <span class="pagenum" id="page97"><span
  class="smaller">{97}</span></span><i>Dissura maguari</i> having like habits. <i>Anastomus</i> is
  called the Shell-Ibis from its cleverness in extracting <i>Unio</i> and other molluscs from their
  shells, and <i>Mycteria</i> thrusts its bill into the ground in search of grubs. The nests are
  frequently in tall trees, but may be on ledges or in cavities of cliffs, or on flat tops of rocky
  hills; the shallow fabric, often of enormous size, being composed of sticks with or without a
  lining of grass, leaves, moss, rushes, feathers, down, or, exceptionally, clay. Colonies are in
  most cases formed, but White Storks occupy separate sites on houses, farms, towers, or even
  cart-wheels purposely erected, and Black Storks breed apart in woods and precipitous gorges. On
  the other hand, more than thirty nests of <i>Anastomus</i> have been observed in one tree. The
  eggs, numbering from three to six, are white and chalky, and stain easily. Incubation lasts nearly
  four weeks. The adult inserts its bill into that of the helpless nestling to feed it, while the
  male attends constantly upon his sitting mate; we may, however, safely disregard the more fabulous
  instances of affection recorded.</p>

  <p>Wood-Ibises are similar in habits, but they are more gregarious; and build smaller nests of
  twigs lined with moss, laying as many as eight white eggs, rarely streaked with pale brown.</p>

  <p><i>Tantalus loculator</i>, the "Wood-Ibis" of the warmer parts of America, is white, with
  metallic greenish-black remiges and rectrices, the bare head and upper neck being covered with
  dusky corrugated skin, and the crown with a smooth plate. The beak and feet are lead-coloured, the
  under wing-coverts pinkish. <i>T.</i> (<i>Pseudotantalus</i>) <i>ibis</i> of the Ethiopian Region
  has only the front of the head naked, but is rosy towards the upper and under wing-coverts, the
  smooth face and feet being red and the bill yellow. <i>T. leucocephalus</i> of the Indian and
  Indo-Chinese countries differs in its yellow face, while the Indo-Malay <i>T. cinereus</i> has it
  red and black.</p>

  <p><i>Anastomus oscitans</i>, the "Open-bill," another Indian and Indo-Chinese species, is white,
  with black scapulars, remiges, and rectrices, yellow bill and feet; the Ethiopian <i>A.
  lamelligerus</i> is metallic black varied by a little rufous, the shafts of the feathers of the
  fore-neck and lower parts in adults expanding into flat shining, horn-like plates at the tip.
  <i>Leptoptilus dubius</i>, the "Adjutant" of the Indian Region, is greenish-black above and white
  below, the fleshy-red head and neck being naked with a few hairs, and a white ruff surmounting the
  shoulders, while a huge ruddy pouch, communicating with the nasal cavity, hangs below the throat.
  The <span class="pagenum" id="page98"><span class="smaller">{98}</span></span>bill is greenish and
  the feet greyish, the former being yellowish and the latter black in the two following species.
  The Ethiopian <i>L. crumenifer</i> has the bare portions spotted with black; <i>L. javanicus</i>
  of Manchuria and the Indian Region has some white on the wing-coverts, yellow naked parts with a
  horny greenish crown, a line of hair on the nape, and a tuft on the fore-neck.</p>

  <p><i>Mycteria americana</i>, the "Jabiru," ranging from Texas to Argentina, is white, with black
  head, neck, bill, and feet; the naked head having a hairy patch on the occiput, and the bare neck
  a red distensible basal band. The Australian and Papuan <i>M.</i> (<i>Xenorhynchus</i>)
  <i>australis</i> is black with purple and green gloss, except the back and lower surface, which
  are white; the head and neck are feathered, the bill is black, the feet are red. The Indian <i>M.
  indica</i> is barely separable. <i>M.</i> (<i>Ephippiorhynchus</i>) <i>senegalensis</i>, the
  Ethiopian "Saddle-billed Stork," differs in having a triangular frontal shield of yellow skin, a
  naked crimson pectoral spot, a crimson bill with black median band, and black metatarsi with
  reddish joints. <i>Dissura episcopus</i> of the Indian and Ethiopian <span class="pagenum"
  id="page99"><span class="smaller">{99}</span></span>Regions is metallic black with white abdomen
  and under tail-coverts, downy white head and neck with black crown, reddish bill and feet. <i>D.
  maguari</i> of South America has the head and neck feathered, naked red lores and sides of the
  throat, white plumage with black wings and tail, yellowish bill and red feet.</p>

  <p><i>Ciconia</i> (<i>Abdimia</i>) <i>abdimii</i> of the Ethiopian Region is bronzy-black with
  white lower surface; the chin, membranous forehead, and tip of the bill being orange-red, the
  remainder of the bill greenish and the bare cheeks bluish. <i>C. nigra</i>, the Black Stork of
  British lists, is iridescent black, with white breast and belly, red bill, feet, and orbits; <i>C.
  alba</i>, the White Stork, a much more common visitor here, is white with black wings and orbits,
  red bill and feet. The former&ndash;reckoning for the irregular distribution characteristic of the
  Family&ndash;may be said to inhabit Europe, Palaearctic Asia, and North Africa, wintering
  southward to India and Cape Colony; the latter is more abundant within a like area, and is
  represented in East Siberia, China, and Japan by <i>C. boyciana</i> with black bill and red
  orbits.</p>

  <p>The sexes in this group are similar; but when immature the whiter species are often more dusky,
  and the blacker species brownish, while the bill and legs may then be greenish instead of red, as
  in <i>C. nigra</i>, or the head and neck more feathered, as in <i>Tantalus</i>.</p>

  <p>The Fossils referred to this Family are <i>Propelargus</i> of the Upper Eocene of France,
  <i>Pelargodes</i>, <i>Tantalus</i>, and possibly <i>Leptoptilus</i> of its Miocene;
  <i>Amphipelargus</i> of the Pliocene of Samos; <i>Palaeociconia</i> of the Plistocene of Brazil;
  <i>Palaeopelargus</i> and <i>Xenorhynchus</i> of that of Queensland.</p>

  <p>Fam. IX. The <b>Ibididae</b>, connected with the Storks through <i>Tantalus</i>, may be divided
  into the Sub-families (1) <i>Ibidinae</i> or Ibises, and (2) <i>Plataleinae</i> or Spoonbills. In
  the former the long bill is weak, nearly cylindrical, and strongly curved; in the latter
  flattened, narrowed in the middle, and dilated into a terminal spoon, which finally turns
  downwards. The nasal grooves are remarkably elongated, the skull is somewhat square in
  <i>Thaumatibis</i> and <i>Graptocephalus</i>. The tibia is partly bare, the metatarsus of medium
  length and often stout, with transverse or hexagonal scales becoming almost reticulated behind, or
  even in front in <i>Hagedashia</i> and <i>Carphibis</i>; the toes are generally long, with short
  anterior webs and variable claws, that of the third digit being sometimes serrated. The moderate
  wings have eleven primaries and from fourteen to <span class="pagenum" id="page100"><span
  class="smaller">{100}</span></span>nineteen secondaries; the tail of twelve rectrices is usually
  short and even, or slightly rounded, but may be long, as in <i>Comatibis</i>, <i>Geronticus</i>,
  <i>Cercibis</i>, and <i>Theristicus</i>; in the last two of which it is cuneate. The furcula is
  <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the tongue rudimentary, the nostrils are pervious, an
  aftershaft is present, but there are no powder-down patches or syringeal muscles. <i>Platalea
  leucorodia</i> has the trachea convoluted like a figure of 8 in old birds. Adults and nestlings
  are uniformly downy, the latter varying from black with a white band over the crown in
  <i>Plegadis</i> to white in <i>Platalea</i>.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Ibidinae.</i>&ndash;Ibises are shy birds, which inhabit not only marshy spots
  and wooded country, but also the driest of plains and rocky gorges, being found both in pairs and
  in flocks. The flight is tolerably high and rapid, with extended neck and legs, most species
  habitually sailing or circling aloft, though <i>Plegadis</i> rises with a whirr and skims along at
  no great elevation. On the ground the gait is graceful, and swimming is certainly practised at
  times, nor are perching or roosting on trees or reeds uncommon habits. The usual note is loud and
  harsh, <i>Ibis melanocephala</i> being said to have a booming call<a id="NtA_98"
  href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> and <i>Inocotis</i> a melancholy scream<a id="NtA_99"
  href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a>; the food consists chiefly of aquatic insects, molluscs,
  crustaceans, and worms; but small fish, lizards, newts, frogs, grasshoppers, and beetles form part
  of the diet; <i>Geronticus</i>, which does not despise carrion, acts as a scavenger. Most Ibises
  wade in pursuit of prey, whether in fresh or salt water, moving the bill to and fro, and probing
  the subjacent mud. Some species breed apart, others in colonies; the nest being placed on trees or
  low bushes, and more rarely among reeds, or, as in <i>Geronticus</i> and <i>Comatibis</i>, in
  holes in cliffs or on ledges. The structure is not remarkably large, and is composed of sticks or
  stems of plants, with or without a lining of herbage, straw, or roots; the eggs, from two to four
  in number, being deep green-blue in <i>Plegadis</i>, pale blue in <i>Graptocephalus</i>, similar
  or darker in <i>Inocotis</i>, olive-green in <i>Hagedashia</i>, and greenish-white in <i>Ibis</i>
  and <i>Eudocimus</i>, or even brownish in the last-named. In all except the first two there are
  generally reddish or brownish markings. Incubation lasts about three weeks.</p>

  <p><i>Eudocimus ruber</i> and <i>E. albus</i>, the Scarlet and White Ibises of tropical America,
  are respectively coloured as the names import, the tips of the longer primaries and of the bill
  being black, while the <span class="pagenum" id="page101"><span
  class="smaller">{101}</span></span>bare front of the head and throat, the remainder of the bill
  and the feet are red. The former, of more eastern range, strays to the southern United States, the
  latter occurring farther north, and breeding in Florida. <i>Lampribis olivacea</i> of West Africa
  is coppery olive-green, with buff centres to the feathers of the loose occipital crest and under
  parts, the wings being more metallic, and the naked forehead and loral region black. The bill and
  feet are red. <i>Plegadis falcinellus</i>, the Glossy Ibis, which occasionally visits Britain, is
  found irregularly in Northern Europe and commonly in the south, extending through most of Asia and
  North Africa, and migrating as far as Australia and Natal. It also occurs in the South-Eastern
  United States and the West Indies. The head, neck, mantle, and lower surface are chestnut, the
  remaining parts purplish-green and bronzy, with bare greenish lores and blackish bill and feet;
  <i>P. guarauna</i>, which represents the genus from the Western and Southern United States and the
  Hawaiian Islands to Patagonia, having red lores, white feathers round the beak, and at times red
  bill and feet. <i>P. ridgwayi</i> of Peru and Chili is purplish-black below, with reddish-grey
  bill and black feet. <i>Cercibis oxycerca</i>, found from Colombia to Upper Amazonia, is dark
  olive-green with a little purple and blue gloss, the naked face and throat being pinkish and the
  bill and feet yellowish. The crest is slight, while a line of feathers ascends the throat.
  <i>Lophotibis cristata</i>, confined to Madagascar, is reddish-chestnut, with white wings,
  blue-green tail, and an enormous crest combining all three colours; the bill is greenish, the feet
  and the bare orbital region are red. <i>Phimosus infuscatus</i>, ranging from Colombia to
  Argentina, is bronzy-green with purple reflexions, the feet, bill, and face being pink, with
  papillae on the forehead and cheeks. The slightly crested <i>Harpiprion cayennensis</i>, occurring
  from Panama to South Brazil, is similarly coloured, but has greenish-grey bill, feet, and naked
  skin on the lores, chin, and sides of the throat. <i>Molybdophanes caerulescens</i> of Brazil and
  Argentina is greyish-green with dark bluish remiges, grey-brown crown, nuchal crest and lower
  parts, white frontal band, naked black chin and warty lores, black bill and yellow feet.
  <i>Theristicus caudatus</i> of Guiana is greenish-brown, with orange-buff head and neck, blackish
  under parts, and partially white wing-coverts; the papillose lores, upper throat, and orbits being
  naked and black, and a whitish tuft adorning the chin. The bill is black with greenish tip, and
  the feet are red. <span class="pagenum" id="page102"><span
  class="smaller">{102}</span></span><i>T. melanopis</i>, differing in its rufous breast, inhabits
  America from Peru and Brazil southwards; <i>T. branickii</i> being probably identical.
  <i>Bostrychia carunculata</i> of North-East Africa is greenish-brown with metallic reflexions and
  white on the wing-coverts, the crested head and under surface having whitish margins to the
  feathers, and the bill, feet, and a long thin gular caruncle being red. <i>Hagedashia
  hagedash</i>, of the Ethiopian Region generally, is somewhat similar but brighter, with no white
  on the wing and no crest or wattle; the dusky lores are bare and warty, the bill is black with
  crimson base to the culmen, and the feet are chiefly red. <i>Geronticus calvus</i> of South
  Africa, except for its shorter crest and greenish-white fore-neck, is not unlike <i>Comatibis
  comata</i> of Northern Africa, Arabia, and the Euphrates, which is metallic greenish-black with a
  large bronzy-red patch on each wing, a fine nuchal tuft of narrow feathers, red bill, feet, and
  bare skin of the head and throat. There is some question here as to the colour of the naked
  spaces. <i>Nipponia nippon</i>, of East Siberia, Corea, Japan, China, and Formosa, is white with
  pinkish remiges and rectrices; a long pendent crest graces the nape, the bare face is vermilion,
  the bill black with red tip, while the feet are lighter red. <i>Graptocephalus davisoni</i> of the
  Burmese Countries and Cochin China and <i>Inocotis papillosus</i> of India are both dusky brown,
  with bluish-black wings and tail, a white patch on the wing-coverts, greyish bill, and red feet;
  but whereas in the former the black naked head is separated by a bare bluish-white collar from the
  neck, in the latter the hinder crown is dotted with red papillae. <i>Carphibis spinicollis</i> of
  Australia is black with purple and coppery sheen, the sides of the downy neck, the tail, and the
  abdomen being white, and the feathers of the chest, which are converted into stiff straw-like
  processes, yellowish. The naked head and throat are black, the bill is black with brown bars at
  the base, the tibiae are crimson, and the metatarsi dusky. The huge <i>Thaumatibis gigantea</i> of
  Cochin China is blackish-brown glossed with green, and shows much grey on the wing; the scapulars
  are decomposed and the head and upper neck bare; the nape is crossed by black bars, and the bill
  and feet are dull red. <i>Ibis aethiopica</i>, the Sacred Ibis of the ancient Egyptians, of which
  mummies are so often found in the temples, represented to that people the moon-god Thoth, and is
  now the Abou-Hannes or Father John of Abyssinia. It inhabits the Ethiopian Region, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page103"><span class="smaller">{103}</span></span>being most plentiful on the
  Upper Nile, though wandering to the Persian Gulf, Egypt, and Algeria. The bare head and neck, the
  bill, feet, and tips of the primaries are black; the decomposed inner secondaries and scapulars,
  which in summer curve gracefully over the hinder parts, are iridescent black, the remainder of the
  plumage is white. <i>I. bernieri</i> of Madagascar, and probably Aldabra Island, has white
  primaries, as has <i>I. melanocephala</i>, ranging from India and Java to Japan. The latter,
  moreover, develops in the breeding season a ruff of long plumes on the fore-neck, similar to that
  of <i>I. molucca</i> of Australia, Papuasia, and Ceram, which is distinguished by ten pink bars
  crossing the occiput and nape, and pink spots on the crown.</p>

  <p>The sexes are similar, but young Ibises are comparatively dull, and have feathered heads and
  necks, while crests and ornamental plumes are generally absent. In immature examples of
  <i>Ibis</i> and elsewhere the head and neck are black and white, in <i>Nipponia</i> the plumage is
  apparently grey, in <i>Eudocimus</i> chiefly brown.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Plataleinae.</i>&ndash;Spoonbills are shy gregarious birds, frequenting creeks
  of the sea or marshes, where they may be seen wading ankle-deep in water, hunting for the fish,
  frogs, crustaceans, molluscs, beetles, and insect-larvae on which they live, or searching the
  ground in drier spots. They walk sedately, and fly with easy flapping action and outstretched head
  and legs, now and then rising spirally to float aloft; while swimming, perching, or standing on
  one leg are ordinary habits. In feeding, the beak is moved from side to side in semicircular
  fashion, the body acting in unison. There are no true vocal muscles, the voice being a harsh quack
  or deep Heron-like note; but a clattering of the bill is heard at times, less noisy than in
  Storks. The nest, when in reed-beds, is a mass of twigs, flags, and the like, placed on the ground
  or on low bushes; but it is commonly a large platform of sticks in a tree, the three to five
  roughish eggs being dull white with red-brown spotting. Colonies are nearly always formed.</p>

  <p><i>Platalea leucorodia</i>, the Spoonbill, which once bred regularly in England, ranges over
  Central and Southern Europe and Northern Africa, to Central Asia, Ceylon, and China; <i>P.
  regia</i> inhabits Australia, and probably Borneo, Celebes, the Moluccas, and New Guinea, straying
  also to New Zealand; <i>P. minor</i> occurs in China, Corea, Japan, and Formosa; <i>P. alba</i> in
  the Ethiopian Region with Madagascar. The plumage is white, with bare lores orbits, and throat,
  and a fine nuchal crest in the breeding season, the fore-neck being tinged with buff, except in
  the last-named.</p>

  <p><i>P. leucorodia</i> has yellow naked areas, black feet and bill, with yellow bars and tip to
  the latter; <i>P. minor</i> differs in having the neck-feathers produced to a point on the black
  throat; <i>P. regia</i> has the above parts, except a portion of the orbits, black, and <i>P.

  plumes on the fore-neck in the nuptial period; the naked forehead, ocular region, throat, bill,
  and feet being yellow; while a black line separates the gorge from the feathered parts in the
  adult. <i>Ajaja rosea</i> of tropical America, which reaches the South-East United States, is
  rose-pink, with white neck, back, and breast, pinkish-buff tail, and carmine wing- and
  tail-coverts; the bare head is yellowish-green, the orbits and throat are orange, the bill is
  greenish-blue with grey and black base, the feet are crimson, while a curly pink tuft is developed
  on the fore-neck in the breeding season.</p>

  <p>The female Spoonbill is like the male. The young seem to be duller, with no crest or ornamental
  plumes; in some cases the primaries are tipped with black, in <i>Ajaja</i> the head is entirely
  feathered.</p>

  <p>Of fossil forms, <i>Ibidopsis</i> occurs in the Upper Eocene of England, <i>Ibis</i> and
  <i>Ibidopodia</i>, the latter of which connects the Ibises with the Storks, in the Miocene of
  France, <i>Ibis</i> also in that of Bavaria, <i>Protibis</i> in that of Patagonia, <i>Platalea</i>
  in the Queensland drifts.</p>

  <p>Fams. X.-XI. The Sub-Order <span class="sc">Phoenicopteri</span>, including the
  <b>Phoenicopteridae</b> or Flamingos and the extinct <b>Palaelodidae</b>, stands midway between
  the Storks and the Geese, having been on that account termed <span class="sc">Amphimorphae</span>
  by Huxley, a term equivalent to the <span class="sc">Odontoglossae</span> of Nitzsch. The
  extraordinary Flamingos have very long slender necks and unwieldy-looking bills, high at the base
  and abruptly bent down in the middle, the maxilla being highly movable and in some cases smaller
  than the nearly immovable grooved mandible&ndash;a condition of affairs seldom found elsewhere,
  and correlated with the peculiar method of feeding. As in the Anseres, the beak&ndash;which is
  short and straight in the young&ndash;is covered with a soft membrane, and ends in a black
  nail-like process rich in nerves, the margins being furnished in the adult with horny lamellae.
  The legs are unusually long, with nearly bare tibiae and laterally compressed metatarsi, covered
  with broad scutes which become smaller posteriorly; the hallux is absent or somewhat elevated and
  reduced, while the short anterior toes are fully webbed and have flat stunted claws. The wing is
  fairly long, with twelve primaries and about twenty-two secondaries; the tail is even, with
  fourteen small weak rectrices. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the nostrils
  are pervious, the tongue is thick, an aftershaft is present, and the syrinx is
  tracheo-bronchial.</p>

  <p><i>Phoenicopterus ruber</i>, ranging from Florida to Par&aacute; and the Gal&aacute;pagos, is light vermilion
  with brighter wing-coverts, the yellowish bill having a black tip and the feet being red; the
  other forms are rosy-white with the coverts scarlet, while all have black remiges; the naked
  orbits and lores vary from rose-coloured to yellow, <i>P. minor</i>, <i>P. andinus</i>, and <i>P.
  jamesi</i> having feathered chins. <i>P. roseus</i>, recorded thrice from Britain and several
  times from North Germany, while extending from Central Europe, the Canaries, and Cape Verds to the
  whole of Africa, Lake Baikal, India, and Ceylon, has red feet and a pink bill with black tip;
  <i>P. chilensis</i>, of America south <span class="pagenum" id="page107"><span
  class="smaller">{107}</span></span>of Central Peru, Uruguay, and perhaps Brazil, has green-grey
  metatarsi with red joints, the black on the bill reaching above the bend; <i>P.</i>
  (<i>Phoeniconaias</i>) <i>minor</i>, of the Ethiopian Region, Madagascar, and North-West India, is
  very like <i>P. roseus.</i> <i>P.</i> (<i>Phoenicoparrus</i>) <i>andinus</i>, of the Andes of
  Bolivia, Chili, and Argentina&ndash;the largest species of the Family&ndash;and <i>P. jamesi</i>,
  of South Peru and Chili, lack the hallux, and have the base of the bill yellow and the middle red,
  with yellow and red feet respectively.</p>

  <p>The young are chiefly greyish- or buffish-white, with brown or black markings, rarely seen
  beneath, and duller naked parts; the adults are uniformly downy, the nestlings white and
  woolly.</p>

  <p>Flamingos are shy birds, sometimes found singly, but usually in immense flocks, which fly
  gracefully in <span class="sans fwb">V</span>-shaped formations with alternate flapping and
  gliding motion, or circle around with outstretched neck and legs after rising with some
  difficulty. They spend their time chiefly in wading, the gait being slow and stiff; yet they can
  swim on occasion, and give evidence of their Anserine affinity by loud harsh cries, much
  resembling the gaggling of Geese, and by their helpless state in late summer, due to the loss of
  the flight-feathers. Very curious is their method of feeding, the head being completely inverted
  and directed backwards, as they tramp about in the shallows and seek for the aquatic herbage,
  frogs, crustaceans, molluscs, and so forth, which constitute their food, the lamellae of the bill
  acting as a sifting apparatus. The breeding colonies are situated on some lake, salt lagoon, or
  "marisma" of little depth, with bare shores, the conical or cylindrical mud nests being slightly
  hollowed at the top and varying in height from two to fifteen inches according to the amount of
  water. Several hundred individuals commonly breed together, though they not infrequently change
  their quarters annually; they are said to fashion the nest with their feet, and lay one or two
  eggs with bluish shell and chalky incrustation, incubation lasting four weeks or more. Mr. Abel
  Chapman,<a id="NtA_101" href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> Sir Henry Blake,<a id="NtA_102"
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> and Mr. Maynard<a id="NtA_103"
  href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> have shewn that the bird sits with her legs doubled under her,
  and her head directed forwards, though reliable persons have asserted that the feet hung down, and
  Dampier (prior to 1683) alleged that the parent stood erect and covered the structure with her
  rump. Eggs are often dropped <span class="pagenum" id="page108"><span
  class="smaller">{108}</span></span>promiscuously by the hen. The young run from the shell, and
  even when fully grown can be driven in flocks by intending captors.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Of extinct forms the allied <i>Agnopterus</i> occurs in the Upper Eocene of France
  and possibly of England; <i>Helornis</i>, with somewhat shorter bones, in the Lower Miocene of
  France and the transition beds of the two formations, as well as the Middle Miocene of Germany;
  and several species of <i>Phoenicopterus</i>, in the French Lower Miocene, the Pliocene of Oregon,
  and the Mare aux Songes in Mauritius. Lastly, there are five species of <i>Palaelodus</i>,
  constituting the family <i>Palaelodidae</i>,<a id="NtA_104" href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> in
  which the bill was probably straight, and the tibia and metatarsus were much shorter than in
  <i>Phoenicopterus</i>, but the toes longer. They are found in lacustrine deposits of the French
  Lower Miocene and the German Middle Miocene, while remains resembling them, to which the name
  <i>Scaniornis</i> has been given, are met with in the Chalk of South Sweden.<a id="NtA_105"
  href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order VI. ANSERIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The Order Anseriformes consists of the Sub-Orders <span class="sc">Palamedeae</span> and <span
  class="sc">Anseres</span>, each containing a single Family, <i>Palamedeidae</i> and
  <i>Anatidae</i> respectively. Lying between the Ciconiiformes and the Falconiformes, the connexion
  of this group with the former is much the most easily recognised, as it shows decided affinities
  to the <span class="sc">Phoenicopteri</span>, while between the <span class="sc">Anseres</span>
  and the Birds of Prey there occurs one of those gaps common to every linear system of
  classification. All the members agree in having the furcula <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped
  and the nostrils pervious. The large spiral penis is unique among the Carinatae, though comparable
  with that of the Ratitae. The down is uniformly distributed in both adults and nestlings, the
  aftershaft is rudimentary or absent, the tongue is thick and fleshy, and has bristly sides in the
  <i>Anatidae</i>; while the possession of two pairs of sterno-tracheal muscles is a marked point of
  distinction from other Carinate Birds. All the species are aquatic, and live almost entirely on
  vegetable matter. The young leave the nest within a few days, or even hours.</p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Palamedeidae.</b>&ndash;In this group the head is small and the neck long, while the
  ribs have no uncinate processes, an archaic feature only found elsewhere among Birds in
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. The <span class="pagenum" id="page109"><span
  class="smaller">{109}</span></span>bill is short and Fowl-like, with a blunt decurved tip, a
  covering of soft skin, and more or less of a cere; the tibiae are partly naked, the entirely
  reticulated metatarsi moderately long and fairly stout; the toes are elongated and have strong
  claws, but only rudimentary anterior webs; the wings are ample and somewhat rounded, with eleven
  primaries and about sixteen large secondaries; the tail has fourteen broad feathers in
  <i>Palamedea</i> and twelve in <i>Chauna</i>.<a id="NtA_106" href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a>
  Very noticeable are the two sharp spurs on the carpal portion of each wing, of which the foremost
  is the biggest; while in the even distribution of the body-plumage this Family recalls the Ratitae
  and the Spheniscidae. The sexes are alike; the nestlings, where known, are clad in yellowish-brown
  and grey down, the wing-spurs being developed in the earliest stages.</p>

  <p>The following account of the habits of <i>Chauna cristata</i>,<a id="NtA_107"
  href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> the Chaj&aacute; or Chaka, must stand for those of the Family, in
  default of further details concerning the more northern forms. This striking species is a common
  resident in the swamps and brackish lagoons of Argentina, where the islands of the intricate
  morasses often hold flocks of more than a hundred individuals, the separate pairs being said to
  mate for life. The flight is slow, with powerful strokes of the wing, the birds being greatly
  addicted to soaring in spiral circles until they are hardly visible, and at times floating lazily
  upon the breeze. They rise noisily from the ground with laboured action, and are occasionally seen
  to perch in trees; but they are by nature waders which swim with considerable facility, and, when
  they do so, their bodies shew well above the water, owing no doubt to the same pneumaticity which
  causes a crackling noise to be heard when the skin is compressed. The food consists of succulent
  water-plants, seeds, clover, and so forth. The loud cry, uttered with the head thrown back when
  the performer is on the ground, may be heard at a distance of two miles, the male giving vent to a
  "cha-ha" and the female replying with a "cha-ha-li." The regular period for reproduction is the
  southern spring&ndash;September and October&ndash;but it is a remarkable fact that breeding takes
  place also in autumn and even winter; the nest being a massive structure of reeds and rushes
  slightly hollowed above, and standing some two feet high with its foundations in water, or, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page110"><span class="smaller">{110}</span></span>in exceptional cases,
  floating. This nest is placed in some narrow channel or near the side of a lagoon, and contains
  from four to six oval buffish-white eggs. The female rises silently when disturbed, nor do the
  parents usually attack an intruder; but wounded birds are dangerous to approach, and make good use
  of their sharp spurs. The voice of the young is a feeble chirp; they are often trained, as they
  grow up, to act as guardians to the poultry of their owners. The flesh is coarse and dark, with a
  duck-like flavour.</p>

  <p><i>Palamedea cornuta</i>, the Horned Screamer, found from Guiana, Venezuela, and Amazonia to
  Ecuador and Eastern Peru, is glossy black with an admixture of white on the crown, lesser
  wing-coverts, and carpal edge; greyish foreneck, white abdomen, brownish-grey bill, and ashy feet.
  The lores are feathered, and a long, slender, yellowish-white horn adorns the forehead. The female
  is said to have buff on the wing-coverts. <i>Chauna chavaria</i> (<i>derbiana</i> auctt.) occurs
  in Venezuela and Colombia; it is glossy slate-black with greyer head and occipital crest, white
  cheeks and throat, and a little white on the wing. The naked lores are pink, the bill and feet
  apparently red. <i>C. cristata</i> (<i>chavaria</i> auctt.) differs in being dark grey, with a
  black ring round the neck and whitish-grey cheeks and throat. This is the largest form, and is
  bigger than a Turkey; it ranges from South Brazil to Argentina, and shares with <i>Cariama</i>
  (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page258">258</a></span>) the name of Crested Screamer.</p>

  <p>Fam. II. The Sub-Order <span class="sc">Anseres</span> contains the single <span
  class="pagenum" id="page111"><span class="smaller">{111}</span></span>cosmopolitan Family
  <b>Anatidae</b>, with the Swans, Geese, and Ducks; where, in spite of many attempts at
  subdivision, the lines of demarcation cannot yet be finally determined. Count Salvadori, however,
  having lately propounded a carefully-elaborated arrangement,<a id="NtA_108"
  href="#Nt_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> I have adopted his Sub-families in the present volume, viz.
  (1) <i>Merginae</i>, (2) <i>Merganettinae</i>, (3) <i>Erismaturinae</i>, (4) <i>Fuligulinae</i>,
  (5) <i>Anatinae</i>, (6) <i>Chenonettinae</i>, (7) <i>Anserinae</i>, (8) <i>Cereopsinae</i>, (9)
  <i>Plectropterinae</i>, (10) <i>Anseranatinae</i>, and (11) <i>Cygninae</i>.</p>

  <p>The skull is short and robust; while the neck is abnormally developed, with extra vertebrae, in
  the Swans, and is usually long, though less so in the Sea-Ducks; in the <i>Merginae</i> and some
  <i>Fuligulinae</i> the customary posterior notches in the sternum are converted into two complete
  fenestrae or apertures. The bill is almost entirely covered with a soft sensitive membrane, ending
  in a horny process termed the nail, the skin being warty in <i>Anseranas</i> and <i>Chen
  rossi</i>; <i>Cereopsis</i> has a large tumid cere; both sexes of <i>Cygnus melanocoryphus</i> and
  <i>C. olor</i> have a knob at the base of the culmen, as have the males of <i>Plectropterus</i>,
  <i>Tadorna cornuta</i>, and the domesticated form of <i>Cycnopsis cycno&iuml;des</i>; the same sex of
  <i>Somateria spectabilis</i> has the posterior portion of the maxilla spread into a disk;
  <i>Oedemia</i> has it considerably swollen even in the female; <i>Cairina</i> and
  <i>Plectropterus</i> have caruncles on the forehead; <i>Sarcidiornis</i> has a fleshy comb at the
  proximal extremity of the beak in the male; while <i>Biziura</i> has a dependent flap on the chin,
  and a small subgular pouch. The bill is usually broad and depressed, and may be sub-conical, as in
  many Geese; spatulate, as in <i>Spatula</i> and <i>Malacorhynchus</i>; or somewhat less dilated,
  as in <i>Chaulelasmus</i>, and so forth. There is a distinct hook at the tip in <i>Mergus</i>,
  <i>Dendrocycna</i>, and <i>Aex</i>; the culmen is concave in <i>Marmaronetta</i> and
  <i>Stictonetta</i>; the nail is bent inwards in the latter and <i>Erismatura</i>, while the
  maxilla may overlap the mandible, or the covering membrane may even hang over the latter, as in
  <i>Malacorhynchus</i>, <i>Hymenolaemus</i>, and to a less extent in <i>Elasmonetta</i> and
  <i>Nesonetta</i>. The length is very variable, but the thin elongated "sawbill" of <i>Mergus</i>,
  with its serrated edges, is especially remarkable. Most characteristic of the Family is the
  presence of highly-developed lamellae or transverse tooth-like processes on both maxilla and
  mandible, which are visible when <span class="pagenum" id="page112"><span
  class="smaller">{112}</span></span>the jaws are closed in many cases, and are comparable to the
  similar formations in <i>Prion</i> (Procellariidae) and the Phoenicopteridae. They act no doubt as
  a sifting apparatus, but may assist in nipping off herbage and gripping fish, the piscivorous
  Mergansers having them directed backwards. The metatarsus is normally short or moderate, though
  occasionally long, as in <i>Plectropterus</i> and <i>Dendrocycna</i>; it may be stout and
  roundish, as in <i>Anser</i>, or laterally compressed, as in <i>Fuligula</i>; and is usually
  reticulated with transverse scutellae in front, though wholly reticulated in the Cygninae,
  Anserinae, and <i>Dendrocycna</i>. The anterior toes are fully webbed, <i>Anseranas</i> and
  <i>Cereopsis</i> alone having the foot semi-palmated; the hallux is short and
  elevated&ndash;except in the former species, where it is long and incumbent&ndash;and possesses a
  broad membranous lobe in the Merginae, Merganettinae, Erismaturinae, and Fuligulinae, while a very
  narrow membrane may be observed in the Anatinae and Chenonettinae. The claws are as a rule small
  and curved, but are long and sharp in <i>Anseranas</i>, <i>Dendrocycna</i>, <i>Nettopus</i>, and
  <i>Plectropterus</i>. The wings vary considerably, but are usually ample and rather long, though
  short in <i>Cosmonetta</i>, <i>Erismatura</i>, and <i>Tachyeres</i>; the number of primaries is
  eleven, and of secondaries from fifteen to twenty-eight, a horny spur being developed on the
  pollex, or even on the index, in <i>Plectropterus</i>, <i>Sarcidiornis</i>, <i>Chenalopex</i>, and
  <i>Merganetta</i>. The tail is, generally speaking, short, and may be narrow and pointed, as in
  <i>Anas</i>, <i>Dafila</i>, and <i>Harelda</i>; in <i>Aex</i>, <i>Querquedula</i>, <i>Tadorna</i>,
  and so forth, it is rounded; in <i>Chenalopex</i> squarer; and in <i>Sarcidiornis</i> and
  <i>Asarcornis</i> more cuneate. In <i>Tachyeres</i> the two median rectrices are long and
  recurved, and in the males of <i>Harelda</i> and <i>Dafila</i>, they are inordinately produced;
  while all the feathers have spiny shafts and narrow webs in the Erismaturinae and Merganettinae.
  The number varies from twelve to twenty-four, with even more in Swans. In <i>Eunetta</i> the upper
  and under tail-coverts exceed the tail itself.</p>

  <p>The formation and disposition of the trachea<a id="NtA_109" href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a>
  are of great importance. <i>Cygnus musicus</i>, <i>C. buccinator</i>, <i>C. bewicki</i>, and <i>C.
  columbianus</i> have a peculiar cavity in the sternum, while the windpipe, entering in front of
  the clavicles, traverses and retraverses the swollen keel, which in old birds it penetrates to its
  furthest extremity, the direction being changed in the two last from vertical <span
  class="pagenum" id="page113"><span class="smaller">{113}</span></span>to horizontal.
  <i>Anseranas</i> shews a double loop in this organ,<a id="NtA_110"
  href="#Nt_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> and in the males of many Ducks an enlargement is found at its
  junction with the bronchial tubes, consisting of a round bony structure, termed the <i>bulla
  ossea</i> or "labyrinth." Similar structures have been noticed in <i>Chenalopex</i>,
  <i>Dendrocycna</i>, <i>Chlo&euml;phaga</i>, <i>Plectropterus</i>, and <i>Sarcidiornis</i>; and in the
  Fuligulinae they shew apertures with membranous coverings; <i>Metopiana peposaca</i>, <i>Mergus
  merganser</i>, <i>M. serrator</i>, <i>Tadorna cornuta</i>, <i>Oedemia fusca</i>, and (doubtfully)
  <i>Oe. perspicillata</i> are stated to have an additional bulb, but <i>Oe. nigra</i> has none.
  <i>Clangula glaucion</i> and the Merginae have a swelling in the middle of the trachea.</p>

  <p>The headquarters of the Family are in the north, while Dr. Sclater's calculations,<a
  id="NtA_111" href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> though modified by subsequent discoveries, give a
  good idea of the distribution. He assigns as residents about seventy-seven species to the Northern
  Regions, forty-one to the Neotropical, twenty-nine to the Australian, twenty-two to the Ethiopian,
  and twelve to the Indian; twenty Geese out of thirty-three, seven Swans out of ten, and twenty-six
  Sea-Ducks out of thirty-one belonging to the first. Polynesia is especially poor.</p>

  <p>The Anatidae are for the most part of similar habits, and frequent seas, lakes, rivers, and
  watery spots generally, being found to a great extent in winter on the shore, especially where
  mudflats are exposed by the ebbing tide, and beds of such food-plants as <i>Zostera</i>
  (grass-wrack) are uncovered. Large flocks, which include many migrants, are formed at that season,
  and in spring the ganders and drakes commonly collect into parties while the female is incubating,
  which she does during twenty-one to forty-two days. Later in summer the majority of the Family
  shed their quills simultaneously, and conceal themselves until again capable of flight, the males
  then becoming dull in colour for several weeks, and resembling the other sex.<a id="NtA_112"
  href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> <i>Merganetta</i> is found only on the torrents of the Andes;
  <i>Hymenolaemus</i> and <i>Salvadorina</i> being also residents on mountain streams. The noisy
  flight is extremely powerful, and much swifter than it appears, the wedge-shaped formation which
  Geese affect being especially noticeable; some forms, however, are practically flightless, such as
  <i>Nesonetta</i> and the adult Steamer-Duck (<i>Tachyeres</i>). All the Anatidae swim
  exceptionally well, diving being carried to its perfection in the marine Fuligulinae; while the
  partially-submerged <span class="pagenum" id="page114"><span
  class="smaller">{114}</span></span>position with erect tail when feeding is known to every one.
  The various Swans have a whooping, trumpet-like, or hissing note; that of Geese is a harsh cackle,
  a gaggling sound, a clang or a "honk." Ducks do not always quack, but have whistling or grating
  cries in addition. The usual food is vegetable, consisting of grass, <i>Chara</i>, <i>Zostera</i>,
  <i>Ulva</i>, and other plants; but Mergansers live chiefly on fish, and the bill of fare is varied
  by grain, pulse, berries, frogs, insect-larvae, worms, molluscs, and crustaceans. The nest is
  placed on the ground in thick herbage, or sometimes almost in the water; holes in banks, hollow
  trees, or even branches at a slight elevation being chosen in certain cases: it is composed of
  heather, grass, moss, leaves, or rarely seaweed and twigs, and is lined with down, added gradually
  from the parent's breast during incubation. The eggs, which vary in number from two
  (<i>Biziura</i>) to about a dozen, are smooth and hard-shelled, with a plain white, creamy, or
  green coloration, and are commonly covered when left. The young return for a time to the nest at
  night, and are carefully tended by the female, who is occasionally assisted by the male,
  especially in Swans. It is not certain how tree-building Ducks convey the nestlings to the water,
  though it has been stated that they are carried in the bill; but it is no uncommon sight to see
  ducklings and cygnets climb upon their mother's back and hide beneath her wings when danger
  threatens.</p>

  <p>The sexes in Swans and Geese are usually alike, though exceptions occur, as in
  <i>Chloephaga</i>; in Ducks the male is generally much the finer bird, and has peculiar
  decorations, such as the elongated scapulars and rectrices of <i>Harelda</i> and <i>Dafila</i>;
  the sickle-shaped secondaries of <i>Eunetta</i>, <i>Heniconetta</i>, <i>Arctonetta</i>, and
  <i>Somateria</i>; the stiff feathers on the face in the last three and Camptolaemus; the curly
  tail of <i>Anas boscas</i>; the crest, ruff, and sail of <i>Aex galericulata</i>; or the crests of
  many Fuligulinae and Merginae. Some females have similar but less striking adornments. Among the
  many instances of fine coloration may be mentioned the Red-breasted and Emperor Geese, the
  Harlequin, Mandarin, Pink-headed and Shoveller Ducks, the Sheld-Drake (Fig. 34), and the
  Goosander; while most Swans are pure white. The blue, green, or white speculum&ndash;or
  wing-bar&ndash;in various Ducks adds greatly to their appearance. The young are comparatively
  dull, the nestlings being thickly covered with yellowish down, furnished with barbs and barbules;
  the colour is, however, whitish or grey <span class="pagenum" id="page115"><span
  class="smaller">{115}</span></span>in Swans, and occasionally brown, blackish, or greenish
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Merginae.</i>&ndash;The commonest British species is <i>M. serrator</i>, the
  Red-breasted Merganser, which breeds plentifully in the Scotch Highlands and Ireland, and ranges
  over the northern parts of the globe, extending in winter from the Mediterranean to China, Japan,
  and the Bermudas. The head is glossy green-black with a long hairy crest, the neck is white with a
  black nuchal line, the upper parts are chiefly black, the large white wing-patch is crossed by two
  black bars, while white feathers edged with black adorn the sides of the breast, which is rufous
  with black streaks, and becomes reddish-white towards the abdomen. The female is brown, with
  reddish head and nearly white under surface. The bill and feet are red in this species and the
  next. <i>M. merganser</i>, the Goosander, nests sparingly in North Scotland, and has a similar
  range to the above abroad, though less abundant; it has a green-black head with little crest, a
  black back, almost white wings, and pinkish-white lower neck and under parts. The female has a
  blue-grey back, and lacks the wing-bars of the hen Merganser. The American species, with a black
  alar band, is separated as <i>M. americanus</i>, and the Central Asiatic form as <i>M.
  comatus</i>; <i>M. australis</i>, of the Auckland Islands, has a brown head and neck with long
  crest, a dark grey body with white bands below, a white speculum, and red-brown bill and feet;
  <i>M. brasilianus</i>, of Brazil, is black above with two bars on the white speculum, and white
  below barred with black, the bill and feet being greenish-black. The female has the crown and long
  occipital feathers brown. <i>M. albellus</i>, the Smew, ranging from Lapland eastward to Bering
  Island, but not to North America, and found in winter from Britain and the Mediterranean to North
  India, China, and Japan, is mainly white, with blackish cheeks, occiput, back, remiges, rectrices,
  and two crescentic bands on each side of the breast, the bill and feet being lead-coloured. The
  female has a red-brown head and nape, brownish-grey upper parts, and a smaller crest than the
  male. <i>Lophodytes cucullatus</i>, the Hooded Merganser of North America, which has strayed to
  Greenland and Britain, has black upper and white under parts; the dense compressed crest has the
  posterior part white in the middle, the white speculum shows a pair of black bars, two black
  crescents mark each side of the breast, the long inner secondaries <span class="pagenum"
  id="page116"><span class="smaller">{116}</span></span>are black and white, the bill is black, the
  feet are brown. The female has a red-brown crest, brown chest, and upper surface.</p>

  <p>The members of this Sub-family are shy and wary sea-birds, seldom found on fresh water except
  during the breeding season; they fly well, walk clumsily, and dive admirably, swimming low in the
  water. The cry is a plaintive whistle or loud harsh note; the food consists of little but fish.
  The Red-breasted Merganser breeds in holes in banks, or among grass and heather, laying up to ten
  brownish-green eggs; the Goosander deposits from eight to thirteen, of a fine creamy colour, in
  similar places, or in hollow trees; the Smew and the Hooded Merganser prefer the latter, and lay
  some eight creamy or ivory-white eggs respectively.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Merganettinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Salvadorina waigiuensis</i> of Waigiou has the head
  and neck blackish-brown with paler edges to the feathers, a white chin, black upper parts barred
  with white, and buffish-white under parts with brown abdominal spots; the sides are barred with
  black, and the black and green speculum is bounded by two white bands. The bill and feet are
  yellowish-brown. <i>Hymenolaemus malacorhynchus</i>, the Blue Duck of New Zealand, is lead-blue,
  tinged with olive on the head and spotted with chestnut on the breast, the outer secondaries
  shewing a little white and the inner black. The whitish bill has the dependent membrane (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page111">111</a></span>) black, the feet are brown. This peculiar and
  tame torrent-duck is rarely seen on the sea, though it can fly from one gorge to another; it swims
  and climbs the boulders with ease, has a whirring note, and feeds chiefly on insect-larvae. It
  deposits five creamy eggs in holes or under tussocks of grass. <i>Merganetta armata</i>, of Chili,
  is black above with white edges to the feathers, and rufous with black streaks below; the head and
  neck are white, with black crown, vertical eye-stripe, throat, chest, and streaks down the back
  and sides of the neck; the bronzy-green speculum has a white band on each side, the bill is
  yellow, the feet are reddish. <i>M. frenata</i>, of Chili, is very similar; <i>M. turneri</i>, of
  South Peru, has a white throat and rufous edges to the feathers of the back; <i>M. leucogenys</i>,
  of Peru, has a whitish throat and breast; while <i>M. garleppi</i>, of Bolivia and Tucuman, and
  <i>M. columbiana</i>, of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, differ but little from the last-named.
  The females are grey and black above and uniform cinnamon below. These curious Ducks are
  restricted to the torrents of the Andes, where they <span class="pagenum" id="page117"><span
  class="smaller">{117}</span></span>are found in pairs, plunging in the cascades, diving below the
  boulders, or stemming the impetuous current with equal facility.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Erismaturinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Biziura lobata</i>, of Tasmania and
  Australia&ndash;except the north&ndash;is brown with buff mottlings, the bill and its leathery
  appendage being greenish-black and the feet dusky. The smaller female has less chin-lobe. This
  species frequents the sea as well as lakes, roosts in trees, and when diving remains long
  submerged; the food consists of mussels, leeches, and aquatic worms; the note resembles the
  dropping of water. The nest, placed on a stump or in a bank, contains two olive eggs; the musky
  smell of the sitting female having suggested the name of Musk Duck.</p>

  <p><i>Erismatura</i> contains seven "Lake Ducks," inhabitants of fresh-water lagoons, which dive
  like Grebes, and remain with only the bill exposed; they are often tame, and when disturbed splash
  along the surface like a Moor-hen, to settle again almost immediately; in swimming the spiny tail
  is carried erect, suggesting a comparison to a "two-peaked saddle." The note is said to be a
  curious inward sound; the food is of fish, <span class="pagenum" id="page118"><span
  class="smaller">{118}</span></span>molluscs, and insects; while the nest, built in rushy places,
  contains up to ten coarse-grained white eggs.<a id="NtA_113" href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a>
  <i>E. leucocephala</i>, ranging from the Mediterranean to Southern Siberia, and in winter to
  North-West India or, exceptionally, to Holland, is rufous-brown with black vermiculations and
  bars, black crown and neck-ring; the rest of the head and neck being white, the bill blue, the
  feet dusky. <i>E. jamaicensis</i>, of Central and temperate North America, <i>E. ferruginea</i>,
  of Bolivia and Peru, <i>E. aequatorialis</i>, of Ecuador, <i>E. maccoa</i>, of South and East
  Africa, <i>E. vittata</i>, of southern South America, and <i>E. australis</i>, of South and West
  Australia and Tasmania, are brown with greyer belly mottled with dusky; the head and neck being
  black, except for the white cheeks and chin in the first-named and the chin only in the second and
  third. <i>E. aequatorialis</i> has white instead of rufous under tail-coverts; <i>E. maccoa</i>
  has white axillaries as opposed to grey in <i>E. vittata</i>; <i>E. australis</i> is much deeper
  chestnut. The females are decidedly duller. <i>E.</i> (<i>Nomonyx</i>) <i>dominicus</i>, of
  Central, Southern, and, accidentally, Eastern North America, has the feathers of the back black in
  the middle and a white speculum. <i>Thalassiornis leuconota</i>, of South and East Africa with
  Madagascar, is variegated with black and ochreous yellow, the rump being white, the wings, tail,
  and feet brownish, the bill blue-grey. It dives much, flies little, and lays about four greenish
  eggs.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 4. <i>Fuligulinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Somateria mollissima</i>, the Eider Duck, breeds
  commonly in Northern Britain, and thence to the Taimyr Peninsula eastwards and the Coppermine
  River westwards, birds from North-East America being separated as <i>S. dresseri</i>; while <i>S.
  v-nigrum</i>, differing in its black <span class="sans fwb">V</span>-shaped throat mark, occupies
  North-East Asia and North-West America. In winter the first-named strays as far as South Europe
  and the United States; the second has occurred in Holland. The male Eider has white upper parts
  and buff chest, black lower back, abdomen, and crown, the last showing a white streak; the wing-
  and tail-quills are brown, the stiff nape-feathers green, while the plumage extends in a peak on
  the culmen. The female is brown, with blackish bands or stripes and two white alar bars. The bill
  and feet are olive-green. <i>S. spectabilis</i>, the King-Eider of the Northern Arctic Regions,
  rarely wandering in winter to Britain, France, New Jersey, and California, has the head blue-grey
  with green and white cheeks, and a black chevron on the throat; the remaining portions <span
  class="pagenum" id="page119"><span class="smaller">{119}</span></span>being black except for the
  buff breast, white neck, upper back, lesser wing-coverts, and a patch on each side of the rump.
  The feet and the bill, with its vertical black-edged disc at the base, are orange. The female is
  redder than in the Eider, with a more feathered culmen. These species are essentially maritime,
  only coming to shore to breed; they are semi-gregarious, and form a nest of grass and rubbish, a
  quantity of down underlying the five to eight oily-green eggs. Eider-down is chiefly procured from
  Iceland, Greenland, and protected islands in Norway. The flight is low and heavy, the food
  consists of mussels, starfish, and other sea creatures. <i>Arctonetta fischeri</i>, the Spectacled
  Eider of Alaska, is chiefly white, with dark grey rump and under parts; the head being varied with
  green and decorated with pendent bristly plumes on the occiput, stiff frontal and loral feathers,
  and a satin-like quadrangular patch outlined with black on each side. The tail- and wing-quills
  are brown, except the falcate inner secondaries; the feet are brownish, the bill is orange in the
  male. The female is fulvous and black with bluish beak. <i>Heniconetta stelleri</i> breeds on the
  Arctic shores mainly between the Taimyr Peninsula and Alaska, and has strayed to Britain and even
  France. The head, falcate scapulars, and inner secondaries are white with blue-black outer webs to
  the two latter, the rest of the wing-quills and tail brown; the back, throat, neck, and a spot on
  each side of the breast purplish-black; the lores and short occipital tuft green, the lower parts
  mostly tawny. The female is brown with darker markings, and duller wing-bar. <i>Camptolaemus
  labradorius</i>, the extinct "Pied Duck" of the North Atlantic coast of America, was black, with
  white head, neck, chest, scapulars, and most of the wings except the primaries; it had a black
  stripe down the crown and stiff cheek-feathers. The brownish female shewed a white speculum.</p>

  <p><i>Oedemia nigra</i>, the Scoter or Black Duck, which nests in North Scotland, ranges over
  Northern Europe and Asia to the Taimyr Peninsula, sometimes reaching the Azores and the
  Mediterranean in winter. It is black, with a yellow nasal patch and a swollen base to the culmen,
  the female being dark brown with greyish face and throat, and no protuberance or yellow mark.
  <i>Oe. americana</i> of North-East Asia and North America, migrating to Japan, California, and New
  Jersey, has the knob yellow with red sides, while the female is grey-brown. <i>Oe. fusca</i>, the
  Velvet Scoter, extends from Scandinavia to West Siberia, and occurs <span class="pagenum"
  id="page120"><span class="smaller">{120}</span></span>exceptionally in Greenland, visiting us in
  winter, though rarely reaching Spain and the Adriatic; it is black with a white speculum and mark
  under each eye, the bill being orange with black posterior swelling and lateral line, and the feet
  dull crimson-red. The brownish female has the white speculum, but a brown bill. The very similar
  <i>Oe. deglandi</i>, of North-East America, has the base of the maxilla entirely feathered, as has
  the still blacker <i>Oe. carbo</i>, of North-East Asia. <i>Oe. perspicillata</i>, the Surf-Scoter,
  accidental in Britain and North-West Europe, inhabits the far north of America and the Asiatic
  coasts of Bering Straits, wintering down to Jamaica and California. The black plumage is relieved
  by white patches on the crown and nape; there is a black mark on each side of the crimson,
  scarlet, and orange bill, the feet are crimson, orange, and black. The brown female has
  yellowish-orange feet. Scoters are gregarious birds, usually found some way from land except when
  breeding; the flight is strong; the note guttural, but softer in spring; the food consists of
  fish, molluscs, and crustaceans. They nest near fresh-water lakes and pools, among heather or
  grass, and lay from five to eight yellowish-white eggs.</p>

  <p><i>Cosmonetta histrionica</i>, the Harlequin Duck of Iceland, North-East Asia, Arctic America,
  and possibly the Urals, which reaches Japan, the United States, and exceptionally Britain and
  elsewhere in winter, is grey-blue, curiously marked with black and white on the head, neck, wings,
  and chest; the superciliary streaks and flanks are chestnut, the speculum being purple, the bill
  plumbeous, the feet brown. The female is brown with whitish cheeks and mottlings below. The habits
  of tumbling and diving in rocky torrents have been well described by Mr. Belding;<a id="NtA_114"
  href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> the nest is in banks or under boulders, and contains seven or
  eight buff eggs. <i>Harelda glacialis</i>, the Long-tailed Duck of the Arctic Regions, which
  appears to breed in Shetland, and in winter even reaches the Mediterranean and China, but more
  commonly the Caspian, Lake Baikal, Japan, and the middle United States, is at that season white
  with brownish patches on the sides of the neck, brown-black back, wings, central rectrices, and
  chest. In summer the crown, neck, and scapulars become brown, with rufous edges to the dorsal
  plumage. The bill is pinkish and black, the feet are bluish. The female is brown, with white
  ocular region, neck-ring, and lower parts. This noisy species is called, from its musical
  chattering note, "Calloo" in Shetland <span class="pagenum" id="page121"><span
  class="smaller">{121}</span></span>and "Old Squaw" in America; it flies very swiftly and nests
  near water, laying from six to twelve oblong grey-green eggs.</p>

  <p><i>Clangula glaucion</i>, the Golden-Eye, not yet proved to breed in Britain, though it does so
  in North Germany, the Caucasus, Siberia, and Maine, besides the Arctic Regions generally, is found
  in winter to the Mediterranean, and thence to North India, China, Japan, Mexico, and Cuba. The
  glossy head is green, with a slight crest and white cheek-patches; the upper parts are black with
  white on the wings and scapulars, the lower surface being white, the bill black, the iris golden,
  the feet orange. The female has the head and back brown, the chest grey. Similar to
  <i>Fuligula</i> in general habits, the Rattlewing, as it is often termed from its noisy flight, is
  more partial to inland waters in winter, while for breeding it prefers hollow trees, or nest-boxes
  set up by Lapps and Finns, the ten or twelve eggs being bright green. <i>C. islandica</i>, the
  ordinary species in Iceland, differing from <i>C. glaucion</i> in its purplish head, inhabits
  Arctic America also, and winters in the United States, rarely straying to Britain or the rest of
  Europe. <i>C. albeola</i>, the Buffel-head, of North America, which has visited the Commander
  Islands and Britain, has the head purplish-green with a large white occipital patch, the iris
  brown and the feet pinkish. It breeds to the northward, the eggs being whitish.</p>

  <p><i>Tachyeres cinereus</i>, the Logger-head or Steamer Duck, of Chili, the Falklands, and
  Straits of Magellan, is grey in both sexes, with lighter head, rufous throat, white secondaries
  and belly, orange-yellow bill and feet. The narrow median rectrices are curled up, the wings very
  short; while the adults apparently lose the power of flight. Darwin well describes the noisy
  splashing action, the rapid and flapping swimming movements, the weak diving powers, the strong
  beak adapted for extracting shell-fish, and the voice like that of a bull-frog.<a id="NtA_115"
  href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> From seven to nine eggs are laid among herbage or low
  bushes.</p>

  <p><i>Fuligula marila</i>, the Scaup, of Northern Europe, Asia, and America, which migrates to the
  Mediterranean and Black Seas, North India, China, and Guatemala, has the head, neck, and chest
  greenish-black, the back vermiculated with black and white,<a id="NtA_116"
  href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> the wings and tail dusky, the speculum and under parts white,
  the bill and feet plumbeous. The female is chiefly brown above, with <span class="pagenum"
  id="page122"><span class="smaller">{122}</span></span>white round the base of the bill. <i>F.
  affinis</i>, of North America, has the head purplish; <i>F. cristata</i>, of the whole Palaearctic
  area, breeding freely in Britain and apparently in the Abyssinian highlands, while wintering in
  India, Japan, China, the Malay Archipelago and Polynesia, is distinguished by an occipital crest,
  and in the male by a black back. <i>F. novae zealandiae</i>, of New Zealand, the Auckland and
  Chatham Islands, has a purple and green gloss above, a few white dots on the back, and
  rufous-brown abdominal feathers, the latter being brown and white in the female. <i>F.
  collaris</i>, of North America generally, has a violet tinge on the black portions, a chestnut
  collar, a blue-grey speculum, and white under parts barred with dusky; the bill shows two whitish
  bands; the female has white lores and throat.</p>

  <p><i>Nyroca ferina</i>, the Pochard, which breeds not uncommonly in Britain, ranges from Iceland
  to Japan, and in winter to North Africa, India, and China; it has a chestnut head and neck, a
  black gorget, and upper parts finely freckled with black and white; the speculum is grey, the
  quill-feathers and rump are black, the lower parts greyish-white; the bill is black, banded with
  dull blue, and the feet are bluish. In the female, or Dunbird, the head, neck, and chest are dull
  reddish and the back browner. <i>N. americana</i>, of North America, has a purple shade on the
  head and neck, a white belly, and no black at the base of the bill. The female has a grey-brown
  head. The larger <i>N. vallisneria</i>, the Canvas-Back of the same country, which breeds in the
  north-west, has the crown and comparatively long bill black. The female has some white on the head
  and neck, and is vermiculated with white on the back. <i>N. baeri</i>, of Eastern Asia, has a
  green-black head and neck, but is chiefly brown, with a black-edged white speculum and whitish
  wing-quills, the female being duller with a chestnut cheek-patch. <i>N. africana</i>, the
  White-eyed Duck of British Lists, breeds from Central Europe to the Mediterranean basin, and from
  the Ob Valley to Cashmere, wintering southwards to the Canaries, Abyssinia, and Arrakan. It has a
  chestnut head, neck, and chest, a white spot on the chin, blackish-brown upper parts, a brown
  collar, a black-edged white speculum, a little white on the primaries, and white lower surface,
  the bill and feet being plumbeous and the irides white. The female is duller with browner head.
  <i>N. innotata</i>, of Madagascar, has a darker head and no chin-spot. <i>N. australis</i>, of
  most of the Australian Region, is not dissimilar, but has a brown tip <span class="pagenum"
  id="page123"><span class="smaller">{123}</span></span>to the white speculum and some brown on the
  belly. <i>N. brunnea</i>, of South and East Africa, is brown, mottled with grey above, the head
  and upper neck being dark purplish-chestnut, the lower neck black, the speculum white with a black
  posterior band. Some white shows on the primaries, and the bill and feet are plumbeous. The female
  has white at the base of the bill, on the throat, and behind the eye. <i>N. nationi</i>, of Peru,
  is hardly distinct.</p>

  <p>The majority of these two genera are wary sea-birds, though breeding inland; they feed at dawn
  or dusk on aquatic plants and seeds, molluscs, insects, and even small fish and frogs, chiefly
  obtained by diving, wherein they are great adepts. <i>Vallisneria spiralis</i>, a plant largely
  eaten by the Canvas-Back, accounts for its specific name and possibly for its flavour. The note is
  a grating or guttural sound, varied by a low whistle; the nest is generally close to water, and
  contains from six to thirteen green eggs. <i>N. africana</i>, <i>N. australis</i>, and <i>Fuligula
  novae zealandiae</i> are rather more skulking species with weaker flight, rarely found at sea.</p>

  <p><i>Metopiana peposaca</i>, of South America, northward to Chili and South Brazil, is black with
  grey vermiculations above and on the belly, the cheeks and upper neck are purplish, the speculum
  and inner primaries chiefly white, the bill and its swollen base carmine, the feet yellow. The
  female is brown, with whitish under parts and grey on the wing. It frequents marshes on the
  Pampas, has a rapid heavy flight, utters a long hoarse note, and lays a dozen creamy eggs.</p>

  <p><i>Netta rufina</i>, the Red-crested Duck, found from the Mediterranean to the Caspian and
  Turkestan, or to India in winter, rarely occurs in Britain or North Europe, and is recorded once
  from America; it is chiefly greyish-brown above and blacker below, with a large crest on the
  chestnut head, white speculum and sides, red beak and feet. The crestless female is duller, with
  whitish cheeks and throat.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 5. <i>Anatinae</i> or typical Ducks.&ndash;<i>Heteronetta atricapilla</i>, of South
  Brazil, Uruguay, Chili, and Argentina, is dark brown above with black head and rufous
  vermiculations, and white below with dusky markings; the tips of most of the wing-feathers are
  white, the bill is blackish with basi-lateral flesh-coloured spots, the feet are brownish. The
  female's head is brown. <i>Stictonetta naevosa</i>, of West and South Australia and Tasmania, is
  brown with freckles and spots of white in either sex. <i>Marmaronetta angustirostris</i>, ranging
  from South Europe and North Africa to India, and <span class="pagenum" id="page124"><span
  class="smaller">{124}</span></span>occurring in the Canaries, is greyish above, with brown and
  buff marblings, and whitish below with brown bars. It flies low, utters a croaking whistle, and
  lays ten or eleven buff eggs in isolated tussocks. Both sexes of <i>Malacorhynchus
  membranaceus</i>, the Pink-eyed Duck of Australia and Tasmania (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page111">111</a></span>), are grey-brown with lighter dots, and some white on the face,
  wing, and tail; the under parts are whiter with brown bands, while behind each blackish eye-patch
  is a pink mark, situated below a dark line running to the occiput and down the nape. The bill is
  greenish, and the feet are emerald-coloured or yellowish. This species is a fearless denizen of
  still waters, with a habit of laying its six rich buff eggs in old Herons' nests, in holes in
  trees, or on flat branches.</p>

  <p><i>Spatula clypeata</i>, the Shoveller, which now breeds in many parts of Britain, extends from
  about the Arctic Circle to North Africa, Central Asia, and the United States, wintering southward
  to Casamance, Somaliland, Ceylon, Borneo, China, Japan, Colombia, and the West Indies, and
  visiting the Hawaiian islands, the Gilbert Group, and Australia. It is dark brown, relieved by a
  green head, white neck, chestnut breast and belly; the longer scapulars being black with white
  median stripes, the wing-coverts pale blue, the speculum green with white anterior border, the
  bill plumbeous, the feet orange. The female is red-brown with duller wings, while the bill of the
  young shows the spoon-shaped form in about three weeks. <i>S. rhynchotis</i>, of Southern
  Australia, Tasmania, and the New Zealand area, has a dark brown crown, and blue-grey neck, with a
  white lateral line, the chest being whitish and the lower parts chestnut, both with black bands;
  <i>S. platalea</i>, ranging from Peru and Paraguay to Patagonia and the Falklands, is reddish with
  round black spots, having a black crown and rump; whereas <i>S. capensis</i>, of South Africa, has
  a grey-brown head and neck, and brown mantle and under parts with darker mottlings. The wings and
  scapulars are similar in all the above, except in <i>S. capensis</i>, where the latter are dark
  blue-green. The females hardly differ from each other, but that of <i>S. rhynchotis</i> is darker,
  that of <i>S. platalea</i> has a shorter bill, while in both sexes of <i>S. capensis</i> the
  speculum has a blue tinge. Shovellers are somewhat silent birds with a peculiar habit of swimming
  and feeding in circles over spots where Diving Ducks are submerged<a id="NtA_117"
  href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a>; the diet includes herbage, worms, molluscs, crustaceans, and
  insects; the eggs are pale green.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page125"><span class="smaller">{125}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Querquedula circia</i>, the Garganey, which breeds (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page126">126</a></span>) regularly in East Anglia, ranges through most Palaearctic
  countries, and extends in winter to North Africa, a great part of the Indian Region, and the
  Moluccas; it has a brown crown, back, and chest, the last-named with darker crescents, a chocolate
  neck with white flecks, a white streak above the eye, bluish-grey wing-coverts, green speculum
  with white margins, and long black and white scapulars. <i>Q. discors</i>, its North American
  representative, reaching Ecuador and Peru in the cold season, is redder, with lead-coloured head,
  a white crescent before the eye, and brighter wing-coverts. The brownish females have a dull
  speculum. <i>Q. versicolor</i>, of America south of Paraguay, and <i>Q. puna</i>, of Peru,
  Bolivia, and Chili, have plumbeous wing-coverts; <i>Q. cyanoptera</i>, of western and southern
  South America, has the head and lower surface chestnut.</p>

  <p>The flightless <i>Nesonetta aucklandica</i>, of the Auckland group, hardly differs in colour
  from <i>Elasmonetta chlorotis</i>, of the New Zealand area, which is brown waved with black and
  rufous above, chestnut and reddish with black spots below, the speculum being green and black, the
  gorget whitish. The female is rufous brown.</p>

  <p><i>Dafila acuta</i>, the Pintail or Sea-Pheasant of the northern regions generally, reaching
  North Africa, Ceylon, the Sandwich Islands, Panama, and elsewhere in winter, has a brown head and
  nape, a white line down each side of the neck, grey upper parts vermiculated with dusky, long
  black scapulars and rectrices mostly edged with white, a purple-green speculum margined in turn
  with black and white, a cinnamon bar on the wing-coverts, and a white breast. The female is
  greyish with brown speculum and ochraceous barring above, the markings being oblique on the tail.
  It now breeds in Scotland. <i>D. eatoni</i>, of Kerguelen Island and the Crozets, has a grey
  breast; <i>D. spinicauda</i>, ranging from Peru and South Brazil to Patagonia and the Falklands,
  has a rufous head and blackish speculum, the sexes being nearly alike, as in the next genus.
  <i>Poecilonetta bahamensis</i> of the Bahamas, Antilles, and South America, <i>P. galapagensis</i>
  of the Galapagos, and <i>P. erythrorhyncha</i> of South and East Africa with Madagascar, are
  somewhat similar birds, having reddish plumage spotted with black, whitish cheeks and throat. In
  the first two the tail is buff, in the third the bill is chiefly pink, the speculum in all being
  much as in <i>Dafila</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Nettion crecca</i>, the Teal, extending from Britain over most of Europe and temperate Asia,
  and nesting even in the Azores and <span class="pagenum" id="page126"><span
  class="smaller">{126}</span></span>Kuril Islands, winters in North Africa, India, Ceylon, Siam,
  China, and Japan, and wanders to North America. The head is chestnut with a green eye-patch
  enclosed by a buffish line, the upper parts are vermiculated with black and white, the speculum is
  black, green, and purple with a whitish border, the chest is buff with black spots, the under
  parts are white. <i>N. carolinense</i> of North America, which strays to Europe&ndash;including
  Britain, has a white crescent on each side of the breast. <i>N. formosum</i> of East Siberia, met
  with in winter in China, and accidentally in India, Italy, and France, has the head varied with
  black, green, buff, and white, a bluish wash on the back and chest, a speculum of buff, green, and
  white. In these three species the female is mottled with brown and rufous, and has a duller
  speculum. <i>N. castaneum</i> of Australia and New Zealand, recorded from Celebes and Java, the
  doubtful <i>N. gibberifrons</i> of the Malay Archipelago, <i>N. albigulare</i> of the Andamans,
  <i>N. bernieri</i> of Madagascar, <i>N. capense</i> of South and East Africa, <i>N.
  flavirostre</i> of America south of Southern Brazil and Chili, <i>N. andium</i> of Ecuador and
  Venezuela, <i>N. georgicum</i> of South Georgia, <i>N. punctatum</i> of South and East Africa with
  Madagascar, <i>N. brasiliense</i> of South America generally, and <i>N. torquatum</i> of Paraguay,
  Uruguay, and Argentina, complete the genus. Teal are fresh-water Ducks, feeding chiefly at night
  on water-plants, seeds, worms, and insects; they are rather silent, and have not the rattling
  spring-note of the Garganey. The nest is in both cases usually placed at some distance from water
  in grass, rushes, or heather, the eight to ten eggs being greenish in the Teal and cream-coloured
  in the Garganey.</p>

  <p><i>Mareca penelope</i>, the Wigeon, which breeds in Scotland, and ranges across North Europe
  and Asia to Alaska, occurring in winter as far south as Madeira, Abyssinia, Borneo, or even
  Polynesia, and occasionally on the American coasts, has a rufous head with buff crown, blackish
  throat and quill-feathers, white upper parts vermiculated with black, white wing-coverts and lower
  surface, and a green speculum with a black edge. The female is mottled with brown and rufous
  above, and has a grey-green speculum, and buffish lower parts. This species, which has a whistling
  cry, whence it is termed "Whew," feeds chiefly by day on grass-wrack and the like when frequenting
  the mud-flats in winter; the nest is among dry heather or rushes, and contains from seven to ten
  greenish-buff eggs. <i>M. americana</i>, of North <span class="pagenum" id="page127"><span
  class="smaller">{127}</span></span>America generally, has a whitish head with black spots, which
  cover the crown in the female only. <i>M. sibilatrix</i>, reaching from Chili and Paraguay to
  Patagonia and the Falklands, is chiefly black and white with blue-green nape and black
  speculum.</p>

  <p><i>Chaulelasmus streperus</i>, the Gadwall, which breeds in East Anglia and South Spain, and is
  apparently spreading thence, occurs in the subarctic regions of both Worlds, and migrates to Shoa,
  India, China, Mexico, and Jamaica. <i>C. couesi</i> of the Fanning group may be distinct. The head
  and upper neck are light brown with dusky spots; the back is blackish with grey markings, the rump
  black; the lower parts are white with black crescents on the breast; the wing-coverts grey,
  chestnut, and black. The female is dark brown varied with rufous. The speculum is white. The
  habits are as in most fresh-water Ducks, the eggs being buff.</p>

  <p><i>Eunetta falcata</i> of East Asia and Japan is a fine bird with chestnut crown, bronzy-purple
  cheeks, green occipital crest, white neck ringed with green, grey and black upper parts, and lower
  surface waved with black and white. The white-margined speculum is green, the long thin
  sickle-shaped inner secondaries are black and white, and a patch on each side of the tail is buff.
  Both upper and under tail-coverts exceed the rectrices. The female resembles that of the Gadwall,
  but has a black speculum.</p>

  <p><i>Anas boscas</i>, the Mallard or Wild Duck, ranges from about the Arctic Circle to the
  Azores, North Africa, Cashmere, and the United States, being found southward in winter to India
  and Panama. The head is green with a white collar, the upper parts are grey and brown, the rump is
  black, the speculum purple with margins of black and white, the breast chestnut, the four curly
  central rectrices being black. The female is brown and buff with a green speculum. In the habits
  there is little that is peculiar, but the eggs are greenish. The coloration in the remaining
  species is usually dusky, nor do the sexes differ greatly. <i>A. wyvilliana</i> inhabits the
  Hawaiian, and <i>A. laysanensis</i> the Laysan Islands; <i>A. melleri</i> Madagascar; <i>A.
  obscura</i>, with its two local forms <i>A. fulvigula</i> and <i>A. maculosa</i>, Eastern North
  America; <i>A. diazi</i> and <i>A. aberti</i> Mexico; <i>A. luzonica</i> the Philippines; <i>A.
  superciliosa</i> the Malay Archipelago and Australian Region; <i>A. poccilorhyncha</i>, with red,
  yellow, and black bill, India, Ceylon, and Burma; <i>A. zonorhyncha</i>, where the bill is yellow
  and black and the feet reddish, Eastern Asia; <i>A. undulata</i> and <i>A. sparsa</i>, also with
  yellow and black bill, but <span class="pagenum" id="page128"><span

  </div>

  <p><i>Tadorna cornuta</i>, the Sheld-Drake or Bargander, which ranges from Britain across Europe
  and temperate Asia to Japan, and migrates to the Mediterranean basin, North India, and South
  China, has the bill and the basal knob&ndash;wanting in the female&ndash;red, the feet pink, the
  head glossy green; it shews a white collar on the lower neck followed by a broad chestnut band;
  blackish outer scapulars, remiges, and tip of the tail; a patch of chestnut on the inner
  secondaries, a green speculum, and a brown line down the under parts, the remaining portions being
  white. This bird frequents sandy coasts and muddy flats throughout the year, nesting in burrows,
  or rarely among rocks, masonry, or bushes, and laying some ten shiny white eggs. The flight is
  powerful and heavy; the note is a shrill whistle or barking quack; the food consists of aquatic
  plants, molluscs, and insects. <i>T. radjah</i>, of Australia, Papuasia, and the Moluccas, is
  white in both sexes, with blackish scapulars, back, rump, primaries, and rectrices; the mantle is
  vermiculated with chestnut, the similarly-coloured pectoral band is barred with black, the
  speculum is green with black posterior margin, the bill and feet are whitish. It breeds commonly
  in <span class="pagenum" id="page129"><span class="smaller">{129}</span></span>holes in trees, on
  which it is quite at ease. <i>Casarca rutila</i>, the Ruddy Sheld-Drake or Brahminy Duck of South
  Europe, North Africa, and temperate Asia, which has strayed to Britain and winters in India,
  Burma, and Formosa, has a buff head, separated from the orange-brown body by a black collar in
  summer, white wing-coverts, black wing- and tail-quills, purple and green speculum, and black bill
  and feet. The female is lighter, with no collar. It frequents fresh water, grazes on corn and
  grass like a goose, and breeds in holes of any sort. <i>C. cana</i> of South Africa differs in its
  grey head, rufous collar, and black vermiculations above, the female having the front of the head
  white. <i>C. variegata</i> of New Zealand is black relieved by grey, the neck being brown, the
  anal region and inner secondaries chestnut, the wing-coverts white, the speculum green. The
  hen-bird has the head white, the lower neck, back, and under parts chestnut, varied with black and
  white. <i>C. tadorno&iuml;des</i>, of South and West Australia and Tasmania, has a glossy green head,
  white collar, rufous lower neck and chest, black body with fulvous mottlings, white wing-coverts,
  chestnut inner secondaries, and green speculum, the head of the female being brown.</p>

  <p><i>Chenalopex aegyptiaca</i>, the "Egyptian Goose," found in Palestine and Africa, is rusty or
  buffish-grey, marked above with black, and with red, white, green, and black on the wing. The nape
  and collar are rufous; the breast shews a maroon patch, the bill is pink and black, the feet are
  pink. It has a loud, harsh cry, feeds on land, and lays rather small creamy eggs in cavities of
  rocks, on trees, or even among rushes. <i>C. jubata</i>, of Amazonia and Guiana, is grey, with
  greenish-black back, wings, and tail, ruddy mantle and belly, purplish-green wing-coverts, and
  white speculum. The sexes are alike in this genus and the next.</p>

  <p>In <i>Dendrocycna</i>, containing the Tree-Ducks, which occur mostly in the tropics, the main
  colour is chestnut or dusky-brown, with dark nape and black rump or belly; but the head may be
  lighter, the throat or wing-coverts varied with white, or the flanks barred with black and white.
  <i>D. viduata</i>, of the Ethiopian and Neotropical Regions, has the front of the head white;
  <i>D. autumnalis</i>, of Central America, and <i>D. discolor</i>, its greyer representative in
  northern South America, have red bills and whitish feet; <i>D. arborea</i>, of the Bahamas and
  Antilles, has strongly spotted lower parts, as has the larger <i>D. guttata</i>, of Mindanao,
  Celebes, New Guinea, and the Moluccas; <i>D. fulva</i>, of the Ethiopian, Neotropical, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page130"><span class="smaller">{130}</span></span>and Indian Regions, has
  white upper and under tail-coverts; <i>D. javanica</i>, of the latter area only, has them chestnut
  above and fulvous white below; <i>D. arcuata</i>, ranging from the Malay Archipelago to Fiji, has
  the breast chestnut barred with black; <i>D. eytoni</i>, of Australia, which has strayed to New
  Zealand, has it yellowish-brown. These birds fly slowly and heavily, and perch regularly on trees,
  where they sway awkwardly about upon the branches; the note is a clear whistle or a chattering
  sound; the food consists mainly of fish and water-plants, sought at all times of day. In winter
  the flocks cause great damage to corn or rice near the lagoons and other waters they frequent. The
  nest, placed in hollow trees, stumps, long grass, or deserted habitations of other birds, contains
  from six to twelve white eggs.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 6. <i>Chenonettinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Chenonetta jubata</i> of Australia has a brown head,
  long black feathers on the hind-neck, greyish upper parts with black tail, rump, and edges to the
  scapulars, a green speculum with white borders, a breast mottled with black, grey, and whitish,
  and a black abdomen. The female is paler, with dull speculum and white belly. It lays its
  creamy-white eggs in the bush districts in hollow trees, perching even on the tallest of them, and
  uttering a barking note. <i>Cyanochen cyanoptera</i>, of Abyssinia and Shoa, is grey-brown in both
  sexes, with black wings relieved by lead-blue coverts, and green speculum tipped with white.
  <i>Chlo&euml;phaga hybrida</i>, the Kelp Goose of Patagonia and the Falklands, which lives and breeds
  on the beach, is white, having a black bill with basal yellow spot, and yellow feet. The female is
  brownish-black with white rump, tail, and anal region, and black lower parts barred with white;
  the neck shews narrow white bands on its sides, the black and white wing has the greater coverts
  green, and the bill is flesh-coloured. <i>C. melanoptera</i>, of Western America from Peru
  southwards, is distinguished by brown and white scapulars, black primaries and tail, green and
  purple wing-coverts, red bill and feet; the female being similar. <i>C. magellanica</i>, the
  Upland Goose, coextensive in range with <i>C. hybrida</i>, is white, barred with black above; the
  rump, four median rectrices, and wings being grey-black, with green and white on the wing-coverts,
  and white secondaries; the bill and feet are dusky. The female is rufous and black, with similar
  wings but yellow feet. <i>C. inornata</i>, of Chili, Argentina, and Patagonia, differs in having
  black pectoral bands and a grey head in the female. <i>C. poliocephala</i>, of the same <span
  class="pagenum" id="page131"><span class="smaller">{131}</span></span>countries, with plumbeous,
  and <i>C. rubidiceps</i>, of the Falklands, with cinnamon head, have in both sexes chestnut and
  black plumage, the wing being as in <i>C. magellanica</i>, the bill black, the feet black and
  orange. <i>C. melanoptera</i> will nest in holes in cliffs.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 7. <i>Anserinae.</i>&ndash;In this group the female resembles the male. <i>Nesochen
  sandvicensis</i>, of the Sandwich Islands, has a black head and throat, brown plumage barred with
  whitish and black, and buff sides of the neck with black stripes. It inhabits craters and
  "lava-flows" on hills, and is fond of berries. The members of the genus <i>Bernicla</i>, or Black
  Geese, are grey and black, with a varying amount of white, and have black bills and feet. <i>B.
  brenta</i>, the Brent Goose, our commonest winter species, is brownish-black, with darker head,
  neck, and breast, white tail-coverts and lateral neck-patches. It is found in the Arctic Regions,
  and migrates as far as the Mediterranean and the Mississippi. It feeds by day in shallows on
  grass-wrack, laver, crustaceans, and insects, has a loud note, and lays about four cream-coloured
  eggs. From western Arctic America to the Lena occurs the form <i>B. nigricans</i> with white
  collar and black belly. <i>B. leucopsis</i>, the Bernacle Goose, migrating to the same districts
  as <i>B. brenta</i>, abounding on our west coasts in winter, and occupying in summer Arctic Europe
  and Greenland, where it is supposed to breed, has nested in one place in Norway. The front of the
  head is white, the crown and neck are black, the mantle is lavender-grey marked with black and
  white, the under parts are greyish. Unlike the Brent Goose, it feeds at night. <i>B.
  canadensis</i>, of temperate North America, wintering down to Mexico, has a triangular white patch
  on each side of the black <span class="pagenum" id="page132"><span
  class="smaller">{132}</span></span>head, and is comparatively large; <i>B. hutchinsi</i> is a
  smaller and more Arctic form, <i>B. minima</i> and <i>B. occidentalis</i> north-western races of
  the same. <i>B. ruficollis</i>, the Red-breasted Goose of West Siberia, which migrates southwards,
  strays to Britain, and is portrayed in the paintings of Egypt, is black, with white loral patch,
  rump, sides and belly, the ear-coverts, fore-neck, and chest are chestnut outlined by white, and
  the two wing-bands are grey.</p>

  <p><i>Philacte canagica</i>, the Emperor Goose of North-East Asia and North-West America, is
  blue-grey with black and white bars, the head and nape being white tinted with orange, the throat
  brownish, the bill purplish-blue with white nail, and the feet orange.</p>

  <p><i>Cycnopsis cycno&iuml;des</i>, the Chinese Goose of East Asia, is mainly grey-brown above and
  whitish below, with rufous edges to the feathers; the head and neck are white with a brown band
  down the crown and nape; the bill is black, or in the domesticated form red with a frontal knob;
  the feet are orange.</p>

  <p><i>Anser cinereus</i>, the Grey-Lag, which nests in North Scotland and as far south as Spain
  and Kashgaria, ranges from Iceland to China, the Eastern race being called <i>A. rubrirostris</i>;
  <i>A. albifrons</i>, the White-fronted Goose, is found in Britain and most Palaearctic countries
  in winter, and chiefly eastward of Norway in summer; <i>A. segetum</i>, the Bean Goose, another of
  our hibernal visitants, breeds from Scandinavia to Amurland, and migrates southward to Madeira,
  North Africa, China, and Japan; <i>A. brachyrhynchus</i>, the Pink-footed Goose, extends over
  North Europe, and is common with us in the cold season; <i>A. indicus</i> inhabits Central Asia
  and North India. <i>A. middendorffi</i> (<i>grandis</i>) of East Siberia is a large form of the
  Bean Goose; while the small <i>A. erythropus</i>, once shot in Britain, has a similar range to the
  White-fronted Goose, of which both it and the big <i>A. gambeli</i> of North America may be
  considered sub-species. The general coloration in this genus is grey-brown; in the Grey-Lag the
  bill and feet are flesh-coloured with white nail, in the White-fronted Goose orange, the latter
  having a white forehead and white breast with black bars. In the Bean and Pink-footed Geese the
  nail is black, but the bill and feet are orange-and-black and pink respectively. <i>A. indicus</i>
  is lighter, with brown hind-neck, and two black crescents on the back of the white head. All these
  Grey Geese feed chiefly by day among green corn, stubble, peas, beans or clover, retiring at night
  to sand-banks or mud-flats in <span class="pagenum" id="page133"><span
  class="smaller">{133}</span></span>winter; the note, often syllabled "honk-honk," is at times
  almost a cackle, whence the flocks or "skeins" are called "gaggles." The nest, placed in herbage
  or heather, is of grass, moss, twigs, or aquatic plants, and contains five or more whitish
  eggs.</p>

  <p><i>Chen hyperboreus</i>, the "Wavy" of North-East Asia and North-West America, with its larger
  Eastern American race, <i>C. nivalis</i>, and <i>C. rossi</i> of Arctic America&ndash;which wander
  south in winter, while the first has occurred in Britain and North Europe&ndash;are white, with
  black primaries, purplish-red bills and feet; <i>C. rossi</i> having a warty base to the maxilla.
  <i>C. caerulescens</i>, of eastern North America, is grey-brown, with white head, bluish rump and
  wing-coverts. The food consists of rushes, insects, and berries.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 8. <i>Cereopsinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Cereopsis novae hollandiae</i>, the Cape Barren Goose
  of South-East Australia and Tasmania, is grey-brown, with large yellow cere, chiefly
  reddish-orange feet, black toes and beak. More terrestrial than its nearest kin, it lays similar
  eggs. The very large extinct <i>Cnemiornis</i>, of the superficial deposits of New Zealand, was a
  close ally, with aborted keel to the sternum and short wings useless for flight.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 9. <i>Plectropterinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Aex sponsa</i>,<a id="NtA_118"
  href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> the Summer Duck of North America and Cuba, accidental in
  Jamaica and the Bermudas, has the upper parts mainly glossy green, with purple cheeks, black
  neck-patches, and white stripes on the face and neck; the breast is chestnut with white spots, the
  throat and belly are white, the wing-coverts partly blue, the flanks brown, black, and white; the
  bill is black, white, yellow, purplish, and scarlet; the feet are yellow. It has a long occipital
  crest. The female is grey-brown with metallic gloss, a white throat and eye-space, plumbeous and
  black bill, and brownish feet. This inland species feeds on insects, seeds, leaves, and acorns,
  and lays buff eggs in holes in trees. <i>Aex galericulata</i>, the Mandarin Duck of East Asia, is
  somewhat similar, but has a neck-ruff of narrow chestnut feathers streaked with whitish, a
  chestnut and black "fan" formed by the decurved innermost secondary, a copper, purple, and green
  crest, and a red-brown bill. The female is brown, grey, and white.</p>

  <p><i>Nettopus pulchellus</i>, of Australia, New Guinea, and the Moluccas, has the upper parts and
  neck-collar dark green, the head browner, the remiges and rectrices black with a white wing-bar,
  the cheeks and lower parts white, the sides marked with <span class="pagenum" id="page134"><span
  class="smaller">{134}</span></span>green crescentic bands, and the bill and feet black. <i>N.
  coromandelianus</i>, extending from the Indian Region to Celebes, has a white neck, a brown band
  across the breast, and the flanks freckled with grey; <i>N. albipennis</i>, of East Australia, is
  similar but larger; <i>N. auritus</i>, of West and South Africa with Madagascar, has a sea-green
  patch on each side of the occiput, the lower part of the neck and the flanks being rufous. The
  females are much duller. These Pigmy Geese frequent small lakes and dive admirably; the note is a
  cackle; the nest, placed in holes in trees or ruins, if not among grass, contains from six to
  twelve white eggs.</p>

  <p><i>Pteronetta hartlaubi</i>, of West Africa, is chestnut with black head and blue wing-coverts
  in both sexes. <i>Rhodonessa caryophyllacea</i>, of India and Burma, is rich brown dotted with
  whitish, the head and nape being pink, the speculum salmon-coloured, the bill reddish-white, the
  feet blackish. It lays round white eggs.</p>

  <p><i>Asarcornis scutulata</i>, ranging from East Bengal to Java, has a black and white head,
  black mantle and under surface, greenish-olive upper parts, with black and white on the wings, a
  blue-grey speculum, reddish bill and feet. <i>Sarcidiornis melanonota</i>, of India, Ceylon,
  Burma, and the Ethiopian Region, is black with metallic hues above, and white below; the head and
  neck are black and white, the rump is grey, the tail brown, the feet, bill, and its basal comb or
  caruncle black. <i>S. carunculata</i>, of Brazil, Paraguay, and North Argentina, differs in its
  black rump. The comb is largest in the breeding season, and is wanting in females. These
  Wattle-Ducks perch on trees and breed in cavities of the trunks, laying a dozen or more white
  eggs. The note is harsh and the flight slow. <i>Cairina moschata</i>, the Muscovy&ndash;or more
  correctly Musk&ndash;Duck of ornamental waters, extends from Mexico to Argentina; the crested
  head, neck, and lower parts are brownish-black; the upper surface is glossy green, with purple on
  the back and white wing-coverts; the bill is black and white; the feet are black; and the frontal
  and orbital caruncles of the male red. It inhabits forest-swamps, roosts in trees, eats maize,
  mandioc roots, and herbage, and nests in holes in trees or between forking branches.
  <i>Plectropterus gambensis</i> of Mid-Africa, <i>P. r&uuml;ppelli</i> of the North-East, <i>P.
  niger</i> of the South-East, and <i>P. scioanus</i> of Shoa, the four hardly separable Spur-winged
  Geese, are metallic black, with more or less white on the sides of the head, lesser wing-coverts,
  throat, and abdomen; the feet, bill, frontal knob, <span class="pagenum" id="page135"><span
  class="smaller">{135}</span></span>and caruncles on the forehead when present being red. The
  female has no knob. They frequent marshes, appear to prefer running to flying or perching, and lay
  about eight whitish eggs.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 10. <i>Anseranatinae.</i>&ndash;This contains only <i>Anseranas semipalmata</i> of
  Australia and Tasmania, a white bird with black head, neck, mantle, wings, and tail, reddish beak,
  and yellow feet. It haunts swamps, walks easily, and deposits some five white eggs.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 11. <i>Cygninae.</i>&ndash;In this group the sexes are similar. <i>Coscoroba
  candida</i>, of southern South America, is white, with black tips to the primaries, pinkish bill
  and feet. It feeds on land, has a loud trumpeting cry, and a less noisy flight than the true
  Swans, from which it differs in its feathered lores. <i>Chenopis atrata</i>, the Black Swan of
  Southern Australia and Tasmania, occasionally domesticated in England, is brownish-black, with
  white remiges, black feet, pink lores, and pink bill banded with white, the scapulars and inner
  secondaries being curled.</p>

  <p><i>Cygnus musicus</i>, the Whooper, which used to breed in Orkney, and ranges from Iceland
  through Arctic Europe and Asia, migrating to the Mediterranean, Nepal, China, and Japan, and
  straying to Greenland, is white with black feet and bill, the basal half of the latter being
  yellow, while that colour extends still further on the sides. The flight is accompanied by a
  rushing sound, the note is trumpet-like or whistling, the food consists of aquatic plants, the
  five or more white eggs are laid upon a pile of herbage near water. The smaller <i>C. bewicki</i>,
  where the yellow on the bill does not reach the nostrils, inhabits the Arctic districts from the
  White Sea to the Pacific, wandering in winter to Britain, the Mediterranean, South Siberia, China,
  and Japan. <i>C. columbianus</i> of North America, said to have occurred in Scotland, has merely a
  yellow spot before the eye; <i>C. buccinator</i>, of the interior of North America, has a black
  bill; while <i>C. olor</i>, the Mute or Tame Swan, with its variety the Polish Swan, has the
  fore-part of it orange. <i>C. olor</i> ranges from South Sweden and Denmark through Central Europe
  and Asia, migrating a little southwards. <i>C. melanocoryphus</i>, reaching from South Brazil and
  Chili to Patagonia and the Falklands, has the head and two-thirds of the neck black, with white
  eye-streak; the bill is plumbeous with red base and knob, the feet are pinkish. The protuberance
  is wanting in the young, which are marked with rusty, and have the head brown. Of other species
  immature birds are greyish or dusky, with flesh-coloured <span class="pagenum" id="page136"><span
  class="smaller">{136}</span></span>and black beak, except in <i>C. olor</i>, where it is
  plumbeous. In habits Swans are much alike, though the notes differ somewhat, and the Mute Swan
  merely hisses or croaks in captivity; the latter and the Black Swan are noted for the graceful
  curve of the neck and their greenish eggs; while the wing-feathers and scapulars are habitually
  puffed out when on the water. Swans were "Royal Birds" in mediaeval England, and a licence was
  necessary to keep them, but for this subject and that of the "Swan-marks" on the bill, as well as
  for accounts of decoys, hybrids, and domestic races in the Family, the reader must be referred to

  <p class="ac"><b>Order VII. FALCONIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>Next to the aquatic Anseriformes may be placed the large and important terrestrial Order
  Falconiformes, with its Sub-Orders <span class="sc">Cathartae</span> and <span
  class="sc">Accipitres</span>. The former contains the New-World Vultures (<i>Cathartidae</i> or
  <i>Sarcorhamphidae</i>), possessing striking differences of structure from their allies;<a
  id="NtA_122" href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> the latter, the Secretary-Bird
  (<i>Serpentariidae</i>), the Old-World Vultures (<i>Vulturidae</i>), the Carrion-Hawks, Hawks,
  Eagles, Falcons and their kin (<i>Falconidae</i>), and the Ospreys (<i>Pandionidae</i>). All agree
  in the strong "raptorial" bill with basal cere, the <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped
  furcula, the large crop, the carnivorous habits, the great powers of flight, the superior size of
  the female, and the long nest-occupation of the young; but the Cathartae differ in having pervious
  nostrils, no syringeal muscles, less flattened metatarsi, and so forth.</p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Cathartidae.</b>&ndash;These Vultures range from tropical to temperate America, and
  are often of immense size; the bill is strong, hooked, but blunt; the feet are clumsy with small
  scales; the scutellated toes, of which the mid-digit is longest and the hallux somewhat elevated,
  are unfit for grasping; the claws are obtuse and little curved. The ample wings have eleven
  primaries and from twelve to twenty-five secondaries; the moderate tail is even or rounded, with
  twelve rectrices, or fourteen in <i>Pseudogryphus</i>. The head and long neck are commonly bare,
  but the latter may be covered with stubbly down, which in <i>Gyparchus papa</i> extends to the
  occiput; the naked skin is often brightly coloured and accompanied by caruncles, while the crop is
  bare in <i>Sarcorhamphus</i> and <i>Gyparchus</i>. The eyes are prominent, the cere is horny and
  sometimes very long, the tongue thick and fleshy, the aftershaft absent. The sexes are alike in
  plumage, with evenly distributed down, and the nestlings soon develop a white or rufous
  covering.</p>

  <p>Though, generally speaking, predaceous, the members of this Family only attack disabled
  animals, or often act chiefly as scavengers, whence the smaller forms are commonly found near the
  abodes of man and even in towns. The larger species sail high above the earth with easy,
  long-sustained, and majestic flight, <span class="pagenum" id="page138"><span
  class="smaller">{138}</span></span>accompanied by little movement of the pinions, as they circle
  over the plains or mountain-sides in search of prey. In this quest experiments have shewn that
  they are little guided by smell; rather does some individual, aided by its marvellously keen
  sight, spy the carrion from afar, its motives being instantly divined by its immediate neighbour;
  a third bird is next attracted; and so the tidings spread, until a greedy crowd meets to dismember
  the carcass, to fight over the morsels, and then to sit stupid and gorged, with drooping wings, on
  or near the ground. Except when feeding, the Cathartidae are non-gregarious, though
  "Turkey-Buzzards" and "Black Vultures" roost in company; the latter are said to take to the wing
  with ease, eschewing the preliminary hops of their allies; while all walk well. The voice is a
  hoarse sound or hiss, owing to the absence of syringeal muscles. The nest of sticks is placed in
  trees, cavities of rocks, hollow stumps, or on the ground, and may be bulky or of the slightest
  description; the one or two eggs are white, buff, or greenish, with or without reddish-brown and
  grey blotches. The parents regurgitate food&ndash;at least occasionally&ndash;for the nestlings,
  and eject foul-smelling matter when disturbed.</p>

  <p><i>Sarcorhamphus gryphus</i>, the Condor, only equalled in size among birds that fly by a few
  Old-World Vultures, and appearing still larger in clear mountain air, ranges down western South
  America and up to the Rio Negro on the east of Patagonia. The head and neck are bare, with dull
  red skin, wrinkled in folds on the latter; while an oblique ruff of white down surmounts the black
  plumage, which shews white edges to the wing-coverts and secondaries. The male has a fleshy crest
  extending from the mid-cere to the crown, a large wattle on the throat, and a small caruncle
  below; the irides being in that sex brown, in the female garnet-red. The bill is white with brown
  base. Smaller and browner examples occur in Ecuador, but larger appendages mark those of Chili and
  Patagonia. In the southern portion of their range Condors are found down to the sea-level, but Mr.
  E. Whymper<a id="NtA_123" href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> states that in Ecuador they frequent
  the Andes up to sixteen thousand feet, and rarely descend to the plains. Stupid and voracious,
  they can be lassoed while feeding, and, though they will attack old horses, calves, lambs, goats,
  deer, and dogs, especially when dazzled by the sun, they seldom risk an assault on mankind. The
  nest, of a few sticks, is placed on steep cliffs, and contains two white eggs.</p>

  <p>A young bird was hatched in London after fifty-four days' incubation, but apparently nearly a
  year is taken to gain full powers of flight. <i>Gyparchus papa</i>, the King Vulture, of tropical
  America, save the West Indies, has a small fleshy crest on the cere in both sexes, but no wattles,
  though the skin of the sides of the head is wrinkled; the occiput is hairy, and a ruff of broad
  plumbeous feathers surrounds the neck. The rump, tail, and most of the wings are black; the
  remaining plumage being creamy white, the bare throat and back of the neck yellow, the skin of the
  head and neck elsewhere orange and red with blue patches near the ears, the bill orange and black,
  the irides white. This bird haunts woods near rivers and marshes, especially towards the coast,
  and feeds on snakes and carrion, from which it drives all other species; in flight, habit of
  gorging, and eggs, it resembles the Condor. Little smaller is the Californian Vulture
  (<i>Pseudogryphus californianus</i>), formerly extending to the Fraser River in British <span
  class="pagenum" id="page140"><span class="smaller">{140}</span></span>Columbia, in which the long
  flat head and neck are bare, smooth, and orange-coloured, the bill being whitish and the irides
  carmine. The plumage is dull black with a whitish wing-band, due to the margins of the greater
  coverts and secondaries; lanceolate feathers form a basal ruff round the neck, and extend over the
  lower parts. The habits are similar to those of the foregoing, but the loose nest of sticks,
  placed in cavities of trees or crags, contains one rough greenish-white egg. The genus
  <i>Rhinogryphus</i> or <i>Cathartes</i> ("Turkey-Buzzard") includes <i>R. aura</i>, of temperate
  and tropical America, reaching to Tierra del Fuego and the Falklands, in which the head and upper
  neck are naked, smooth, and crimson; and <i>R. burrovianus</i>, found from Mexico to Brazil, where
  they are orange and the nape is feathered; the yellow-headed <i>R. perniger</i>, of Amazonia,
  being hardly separable. All are black with whitish bill, red irides, and a tuft of bristles in
  front of the eye; but the first has brown-margined feathers and metallic sheen above. In common
  with <i>Catharista</i>, they have the cere very long. During the day-time these quarrelsome
  scavengers, ubiquitous but necessary, haunt the house-tops and roadways of towns and villages,
  whence they retire at night to groves or forests in company; otherwise their habits are those of
  Vultures generally. They have been said to pair for life, while they deposit two whitish eggs with
  red-brown and lilac markings in some hollow of a crag, tree, or log, often on or near the ground,
  adding little, if any, bedding. <i>Catharista atratus</i>, the "Carrion Crow" or Black Vulture,
  which ranges from Argentina and Chili to the West Indies and Carolina, and occasionally further
  north, is most plentiful near the coast; the fearless demeanour, flight, manner of feeding,
  nesting habits and eggs, resembling those of Turkey-Buzzards, though the wing-action is more
  laboured, and the gait shuffling. Audubon says that the males strut and gesticulate like Turkeys
  when courting, while incubation lasts about three weeks. The colour is black, the naked head being
  dusky and the upper neck somewhat corrugated; the bill is blackish with light tip, the irides are
  brown.</p>

  <p>Fossils referred to this Family are met with in North and South America.<a id="NtA_124"
  href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

      secretarius.</i> &times; &#x2151;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Fam. II. <b>Serpentariidae.</b>&ndash;This contains only <i>Serpentarius secretarius</i>, the
  African Secretary-Bird&ndash;now generally recognised as an Accipitrine form&ndash;which is most
  common in the south, though extending northwards to the Gambia, Khartum, and Abyssinia. It was
  first accurately made known in 1769, from an example living in the menagerie of the Prince of
  Orange, by Vosmaer, who was told that at the Cape of Good Hope it was called "Sagittarius," or
  Archer, from its habit of striding like a bowman about to shoot, and that this name had been
  corrupted into "Secretarius." Subsequently&ndash;about 1770&ndash;a pair was <span class="pagenum"
  id="page142"><span class="smaller">{142}</span></span>brought alive to England.<a id="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> The appellation is evidently, however, derived from the nuchal
  tuft, which bears a fancied resemblance to the pen of a clerk stuck above his ear. Standing some
  four feet high on very long legs, this bird gives the impression of a Heron or Crane, and is a
  striking object on its native plains. The short strong beak is greatly arched, and is not toothed,
  the neck is elongated, the body comparatively small, and the metatarsus boldly scutellated all
  round, the short straight toes with their blunt claws being joined anteriorly by small membranes.
  The ample wings have eleven pointed primaries and seventeen secondaries; the graduated tail of
  twelve rectrices has the two obtuse median feathers drooping and much prolonged. Down is evenly
  distributed over the adults, and an aftershaft is present. The general colour is bluish-grey, with
  black wing-quills, lower back and vent; the loose pendent crest on the occiput and nape contains
  ten plumes in pairs, the longer being black and the shorter grey with black ends; the tail is
  grey, subterminally barred with black and tipped with white, which sometimes shews on the short
  close flank-feathers. The long cere, naked sides of the face, and feet are yellow, the irides
  hazel. The sexes are similar.</p>

  <p>In South Africa these useful birds&ndash;favoured by a protecting law&ndash;are often brought
  up tame about the homesteads, where they kill reptiles and keep off feathered intruders, though
  they occasionally tax the poultry-yard themselves; the food consists of small mammals, birds,
  lizards, and tortoises, but above all of snakes and insects. When the Secretary attacks a reptile,
  it advances on foot and delivers a forward kick with its powerful leg, striking simultaneously
  with the knobbed wings, which shield its body; then it retreats with a bound, as the hissing snake
  makes a vicious lunge; but soon, watching its opportunity, breaks through its opponent's guard and
  stands triumphant with crest erect, before swallowing the disabled foe.<a id="NtA_126"
  href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> If, however, the snake touches the bird's flesh, the result is
  reversed; and so well, according to Mr. Atmore,<a id="NtA_127" href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a>
  does the latter know this, that it plucks out instantly any feather that the fangs have reached.
  Possibly reptiles are occasionally killed by being carried aloft and dropped. Usually seen
  stalking easily along, this graceful species can almost out-pace a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page143"><span class="smaller">{143}</span></span>horseman, while it will fly when hard
  pressed, or soar to a considerable height. The huge nest, occupied from year to year, is placed in
  a bush or tree, and is composed of sticks and clay with a lining of wool and hair, the two or
  three eggs being white with rusty markings. In six weeks the downy white young are hatched, which
  remain some four months in the nest, often uttering a harsh cry. The legs of both nestlings and
  adults are very fragile, and snap if they trip while running.</p>

  <p>A fossil form (<i>S. robustus</i>) has been recorded from the Lower Miocene of Allier in
  France.</p>

  <p>Fam. III. <b>Vulturidae.</b>&ndash;The Old-World Vultures have a strong hooked
  bill&ndash;exceptionally slender in <i>Neophron</i>&ndash;which may be sinuate, but has no tooth.
  They possess a horny cere; a comparatively short, stout, reticulated metatarsus, often partly
  feathered; scutellated toes on a level, with bluntish slightly curved claws, and a short membrane
  between the outer and mid digits. They lack the bony ridge found over the eye in the Falconidae.
  The somewhat pointed wings are long and broad, with eleven primaries and from seventeen to
  twenty-five secondaries; the moderate tail, ordinarily of twelve feathers, is rounded, but varies
  to wedge-shaped in <i>Neophron</i>, where, as in <i>Gyps</i>, there are fourteen rectrices. The
  plumage is compact; the crop prominent; the head and neck are bare or sparsely-haired in
  <i>Otogyps</i> and <i>Pseudogyps</i>, more or less downy in <i>Vultur</i>, <i>Lophogyps</i>, and
  <i>Gyps</i>, and partly feathered in <i>Neophron</i>; while a ruff of down or plumes covers the
  shoulders. The nostrils are circular in <i>Vultur</i>, horizontally elongated in <i>Neophron</i>,
  oval and vertical elsewhere; the fleshy tongue may show bristly or upcurved margins, and the
  syrinx has two pairs of tracheo-bronchial muscles. Uniformly distributed down and an aftershaft
  characterize the adults, while the white woolly nestling of <i>Gyps</i> is said to be hatched
  naked.<a id="NtA_128" href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> Except as regards <i>Neophron</i>, the
  habits resemble those of the Cathartidae, the carrion diet producing a most offensive odour. The
  plumage of the sexes is the same.</p>

  <p><i>Vultur monachus</i> (<i>cinereus</i>), the Black Vulture, has its headquarters in the
  Mediterranean Region, whence it extends to the Gold Coast, Nubia, the Lower Danube, North India
  and China, and has strayed to Denmark. Not unlike the more sociable Griffon Vulture in general
  habits, it shows a preference for wooded country, <span class="pagenum" id="page144"><span
  class="smaller">{144}</span></span>constructing a bulky shallow nest of sticks, grass, and wool
  almost invariably on trees, and laying one, or rarely two, white eggs blotched with dark red. The
  plumage is brownish-black, with a ruff of lanceolate feathers below the bare neck, and black down
  on the crown and throat. The naked skin and cere are of a livid flesh-colour, the feet yellowish;
  the bill is black, the iris brown. <i>Lophogyps occipitalis</i>, of East and South Africa and
  Senegal, is dark brown with blacker remiges and rectrices, and some white on the wings; the
  reddish head and neck are bare, except for white down on the crown, which thickens towards the
  occiput; the ruff is brown, the abdomen and crop are white, the feet pinkish; the bill is orange
  with bluish cere, the iris brown. <i>Otogyps auricularis</i>, of North-East and South Africa,
  called the "Eared Vulture" from the fleshy lappets (of the same pinkish colour as the naked head,
  cere, and feet) on the sides of the neck, is brown, with blackish wings and tail, varied by white
  down on the thighs and chest; a brown ruff covers the hind-neck, while the bill and irides are
  yellow. <i>O. calvus</i>, the smaller Pondicherry- or King-Vulture of India, Burma, and Siam, is
  black. These birds usually hunt in pairs, driving all intruders except Eagles from their prey:
  they construct immense stick nests, often used in successive years, on thick bushes or trees;
  straw, leaves, and the like being added for lining, and one white egg, often with red-brown
  markings, deposited. <i>Gyps fulvus</i>, the Griffon Vulture, which has occurred in Germany,
  Poland, and once in Britain, breeds from the Spanish Pyrenees through Southern Europe and Northern
  Africa, reaching lat. 50&deg; N. in Russia, and extending eastward to North India, by way of
  Turkestan, where it overlaps the larger form <i>G. himalayensis</i>. It is fawn-brown above and
  streaky buff below, with nearly black wings and tail, the adults having a downy white ruff,
  represented in the young by a brown collar; the head is thinly covered with white hairs, the beak
  is horn-coloured with blue-black cere, the feet are plumbeous, the irides orange. This active
  though cowardly species is often seen basking on rocks at mid-day; it flies or hovers with easy
  movements, and can soar until it almost disappears in the sky. It has a growling note. The nest, a
  mass of sticks and grass of variable size, is placed on cliffs, and contains one or even two white
  eggs, sometimes with rusty markings. Incubation lasts forty days, the young remaining three months
  in the nest. <i>G. kolbi</i> of South Africa is much paler; <i>G. r&uuml;ppelli</i>, of the north-east
  and south of <span class="pagenum" id="page145"><span class="smaller">{145}</span></span>that
  continent, has a yellower head and browner back; <i>G. indicus</i> of India and the Indo-Malay
  mainland; from which <i>G. pallescens</i> is hardly separable, has a barer head and comparatively
  thin bill; the former breeds in trees in place of rocks. <i>Pseudogyps bengalensis</i>, the
  White-backed Vulture, ranging through India and down the Malay Peninsula, is black above, but
  brownish below, with the thin downy ruff and lower back white; the bill is greyish, the cere,
  feet, naked head and neck are black, the irides brown. This bird snorts, hisses, or even roars,
  and walks easily, though awkwardly. It nests in company on trees, and often lines the large
  stick-fabric with foliage, as do so many other Raptorial forms; the greenish-white eggs, seldom
  marked with red, vary much in bulk. <i>P. africanus</i>, of North-East and West Africa, is
  decidedly browner.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Neophron</i> contains the smallest Vultures, <i>N. percnopterus</i> being called,
  from its frequent occurrence on Egyptian hieroglyphs, the Egyptian Vulture or Pharaoh's Hen. It
  has wandered thrice to Britain and also to North Europe, while it breeds from Savoy and Provence
  to Madeira, the Canaries, the Cape Verds, North Africa, and India, meeting in the last-named the
  smaller <i>N. ginginianus</i>; in winter it visits South Africa, where it is called the "White
  Crow." The plumage is white, with black primaries and partially brown secondaries; a ruff of
  lanceolate feathers extends up to the occiput, the naked head and neck are yellow, the tip of the
  bill alone being black; the feet are pink, the irides crimson. Often seen striding sedately along
  in search of animal and vegetable refuse or dung, this species also follows the plough and devours
  worms, grubs, insects, reptiles, and frogs; while from its alleged habit of breaking bones left by
  other Vultures, it is called Quebranta-huesos or "bone-smasher" by the Spaniards.<a id="NtA_129"
  href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> The flight is slow and easy, the voice a croak. The flat nest
  of sticks, lined with soft materials, and especially rags, is placed on a crag or tree, and
  contains two white eggs with red-brown or claret blotches. <i>N. pileatus</i> of South
  Africa&ndash;which has a larger north-eastern and western form&ndash;is brown, with black wings
  and tail, downy whitish nape, purplish naked areas, dusky bill and feet, and brown irides.</p>

  <p>Of fossil forms there are recorded <i>Gyps melitensis</i><a id="NtA_130"
  href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> from the Plistocene of Malta, and <i>Vultur</i> from that of
  France.<a id="NtA_131" href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fam. IV. <b>Falconidae.</b>&ndash;This group may be divided into the Sub-families (1)
  <i>Gypa&euml;tinae</i> for the L&auml;mmergeiers; (2) <i>Polyborinae</i> for the "Carrion Hawks"; (3)
  <i>Accipitrinae</i> for the Hawks, with <i>Circus</i>, <i>Polyboro&iuml;des</i>, and so forth; (4)
  <i>Aquilinae</i> for the Eagles; (5) <i>Buteoninae</i> for the Buzzards and Kites; and (6)
  <i>Falconinae</i> for the Falcons.</p>

  <p>Though the skull is small in <i>Circus</i> and some other forms, it is usually large and broad,
  being considerably elongated in the Aquilinae. The short stout bill is strongly curved, and
  terminates in a hook, which is often nearly perpendicular, and is specially prominent in
  <i>Rostrhamus</i>, <i>Leptodon</i>, <i>Harpyhalia&euml;tus</i>, <i>Pithecophaga</i> and
  <i>Thrasa&euml;tus</i>; the basal third is straight in Eagles, while the edges of the maxilla are lobed
  or festooned to a variable extent, and in the Falconinae are distinctly toothed, or even bidentate
  in the case of <i>Spiziapteryx</i>, <i>Harpagus</i>, and <i>Baza</i>. A bony ridge over the eye
  conduces to the fierce aspect, especially in the larger species. The feet are robust and
  well-fitted for grasping, and are enormously developed in <i>Thrasa&euml;tus</i>; the metatarsus is
  much flattened, and may be scutellated or reticulated, though the scales are usually smaller
  behind; the tibia generally exceeds it in measurement, but in Accipitrine forms is nearly equal,
  giving them a long-legged appearance. Elongated bare metatarsi are characteristic of
  <i>Circus</i>, <i>Polyboro&iuml;des</i>, and the Polyborinae. The claws are sharp and curved,
  especially in <i>Rostrhamus</i>; a short membrane connects the middle and outer toes, and the
  inner also in the Polyborinae; while their under surface is more or less padded, and exhibits
  rugose spicules below in <i>Busarellus</i>, similar to those in <i>Pandion</i>. The powerful wings
  may be long and pointed, as in the Kites, Falcons, and Harriers; moderate and somewhat rounded, as
  in the Eagles and Buzzards; or short and narrow, as in Hawks. Falconers term the long-winged forms
  "noble," the short-winged ignoble. The tail, usually of medium size, but sometimes very short, as
  in <i>Helotarsus</i> and <i>Gypohierax</i>, is decidedly elongated in the Accipitrinae and
  <i>Polyborus</i>, and also in <i>Milvus</i>, <i>Lophoictinia</i>, <i>Elano&iuml;des</i>, and
  <i>Nauclerus</i>, where it is forked&ndash;very deeply in the two last: it may be wedge-shaped, as
  in <i>Uroa&euml;tus</i>, <i>Thalassa&euml;tus</i>, <i>Harpyhalia&euml;tus</i>, and <i>Gypa&euml;tus</i>; rounded, as
  in <i>Elanus</i> and <i>Halia&euml;tus</i>; nearly even, as in <i>Buteo</i> and <i>Aquila</i>; or
  emarginated, as in <i>Ictinia</i> and <i>Rostrhamus</i>. Normally there are twelve rectrices, but
  <i>Thalassa&euml;tus</i> has fourteen. The colour varies greatly with age, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page147"><span class="smaller">{147}</span></span>and it often takes four years or more to
  attain maturity, the markings commonly changing from longitudinal to transverse; but the sexes are
  usually alike, though the Kestrel, Merlin, Red-footed Falcon, and many Harriers are well-known
  exceptions, the last having generally blue-grey males and brown females. The occipital feathers
  are elongated in several of the Polyborinae, and a full crest occurs in many genera,
  <i>Lophoa&euml;tus</i>, <i>Thrasa&euml;tus</i>, <i>Harpyhalia&euml;tus</i>, <i>Helotarsus</i>, <i>Morphnus</i>,
  and <i>Lophoictinia</i> being especially noticeable; <i>Circus</i> has a facial ruff, coupled with
  exceptionally large aural apertures; the feathers of the neck may be lanceolate, as in
  <i>Halia&euml;tus</i>, or those of the nape, as in <i>Aquila</i>; and the plumage commonly over-hangs
  the metatarsus, which is feathered to the toes in various Aquiline forms, and in
  <i>Archibuteo</i>. The nostrils are circular in the Falconinae, oval or nearly linear elsewhere,
  with a central tubercle in the last-named and the Polyborinae, seldom found in the other
  Sub-families: they are generally in or near the cere, which is almost always fleshy. An aftershaft
  is present; the down in adults is uniform; that of the nestling being woolly and varying from
  white to grey, buff, brown, or black. The feet are yellow, red, or brown; the bill is ordinarily
  dark, and the cere yellow; <i>Gypa&euml;tus</i>, however, has all these parts bluish-grey, with a
  crimson sclerotic membrane (equivalent to the "white of the eye") round the orange iris, the
  latter being yellow or orange in the Accipitrinae, brown in the Falconinae, and varying to red
  elsewhere. The syrinx has two pairs of tracheo-bronchial muscles; the tongue is thick and often
  concave; and Nitzsch<a id="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> has recorded single or
  paired powder-down patches on the lower back of <i>Elano&iuml;des</i>, <i>Elanus</i>,
  <i>Regerhinus</i>, and <i>Circus</i>, with similar but scattered down-feathers in
  <i>Gypa&euml;tus</i>.</p>

  <p>The members of this Family range in size from the mighty L&auml;mmergeier to the tiny Finch-Falcon
  (<i>Microhierax</i>); but they have many habits in common, though <i>Polyborus</i> and
  <i>Milvago</i> are somewhat terrestrial and vulturine, and a few species have crepuscular
  tendencies. They are decidedly non-gregarious, though the Polyborinae, <i>Erythropus</i>, and
  <i>Rostrhamus</i> form partial exceptions; they pair very early in the year, if not for life, the
  larger forms in especial breeding almost before winter is over. Birds of the mountains, the
  plains, and the woods, they can bear the cold of the icy regions or the heat of the Equator, but
  towards <span class="pagenum" id="page148"><span class="smaller">{148}</span></span>either pole
  the number of species decreases perceptibly. The sight is exceptionally keen, and the flight
  generally powerful and rapid; Eagles and Buzzards indeed move heavily to all appearance, as they
  circle or sail around with flapping action, but the spectacle of the former in chase of a grouse
  will quickly disillusion the observer. Kites are still more versatile upon the wing, nor are the
  Polyborine forms always deficient in this respect, while the dash and speed of Hawks and Falcons
  in their different styles is proverbial.<a id="NtA_133" href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>
  Harriers and the like may be seen buoyantly quartering the ground for hours, poising themselves
  almost motionless aloft, or gliding in circles to great heights; and the hovering or stationary
  position on the wing, which gives the name of "Windhover" to the Kestrel, is more general than
  might be supposed throughout the Family. Taken as a class, few birds can fly so well or so
  untiringly, though Vultures, Cranes, Storks, Albatroses, and the larger Gulls have even greater
  powers of endurance; they can, moreover, perch with great facility, and, while seldom running or
  walking fast, can move with freedom upon the ground, where they generally progress by means of
  hops, and aid themselves with their wings. Many of the Falconidae are very quarrelsome, and use
  their talons as weapons of offence, this trait being emphasized at the nesting-quarters, whence
  feathered intruders are rigorously excluded. The cry is shrill, but varies in depth; in the
  Peregrine Falcon it is a succession of short notes, in Eagles it resembles a yelp, in Buzzards a
  cat's mew, in Kites a whistle, and so forth; whereas in <i>Melierax</i> it may almost be called a
  song. The diet varies considerably, and consists of mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, frogs,
  tortoises, crabs, molluscs, and insects. <i>Gypohierax</i>, <i>Aquila</i>, <i>Haliastur</i>,
  <i>Milvago</i>, and <i>Polyborus</i> certainly eat carrion, and the last will attack newly-born
  lambs&ndash;a grievance made the most of by sheep-farmers in the case of Eagles; while the larger
  forms kill fawns, monkeys, foxes, hares, and other creatures of considerable size. Buzzards keep
  down rabbits, and hunt rats and mice as assiduously as Harriers and the Kestrel; the latter
  devours quantities of insects, as do also some of the Polyborinae; and the so-called "Honey"
  Buzzard (<i>Pernis</i>) gains its name from its fondness for grubs of bees or wasps. Kites work
  havoc among poultry; the Golden Eagle, and still more the Peregrine Falcon, among moor-fowl; the
  last two proving an <span class="pagenum" id="page149"><span
  class="smaller">{149}</span></span>advantage in Scotch deer-forests, where the noisy grouse
  disturb the stags, but being in peril of extermination on the moorlands; yet it is questionable
  whether more good than harm is not done by the destruction of weakly game. The Osprey and
  Sea-Eagle eat little but fish, though they are not alone in that habit, while <i>Rostrhamus</i>
  lives almost entirely on fresh-water molluscs. Most members of the Family do not alight to capture
  their prey, but seize it with their sharp talons either sitting or on the wing, the chief
  exceptions being the carrion- and insect-eaters; it is often conveyed to some favourite spot of
  ground or rock to devour, smaller objects being transported in the bill and the bigger torn to
  pieces and stripped before being swallowed. Large bones may be broken up, slender bones bolted
  entire; but hard substances are always ejected subsequently as pellets, after the manner of Owls
  (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page401">401</a></span>), the nature of the diet being readily
  detected from these castings. Exceptionally curious habits are credited to <i>Gypa&euml;tus</i> and
  <i>Gypoictinia</i>, as will be seen below. After a meal, quiescence is the rule, but none of the
  tribe gorge like Vultures. The predilections of species or even of individuals determine the
  situation of the nest, Eagles and other large forms preferring rocks in mountain-glens, lofty
  cliffs, or trees, for their bulky fabric of sticks, heather, and the like, which is lined with
  softer substances, and often bedded with foliage. The larger Falcons frequently select ledges on
  sea-girt or inland crags, and merely scrape a hole in the soil; but they, in common with the
  lesser Falcons, also utilize deserted habitations of Crows and so forth, or even lay their eggs on
  level ground or upon crumbling masonry; while the American "Sparrow-Hawk" (<i>Tinnunculus
  sparverius</i>) commonly appropriates old holes of Woodpeckers. Harriers, <i>Rostrhamus</i>, and
  other forms choose sites in reed-beds, gorse-coverts, fern, rough grass, or corn, and eschew hard
  materials; Hawks usually construct a flat platform of branches lined with thinner twigs. The eggs
  are generally bluish-, greenish-, or yellowish-white, with fine blotches, streaks, and spots of
  red, brown, or claret, chiefly towards the larger end; but in Falcons they are more or less
  covered with ruddy or orange markings, which often obliterate the ground-colour. Unspotted
  specimens are not uncommon, and in the case of Harriers we have an instance of a plain bluish
  coloration, a few rusty stains being exceptionally visible. Alternative sites are frequently
  tenanted, or former nests repaired. Incubation is often of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page150"><span class="smaller">{150}</span></span>considerable duration, and the young remain
  long in the nest&ndash;four months, it is said, in the L&auml;mmergeier; the longevity, too, of Eagles
  is notorious, a span of a hundred years having been actually recorded. Unconscious mimicry is
  shewn by <i>Accipiter pileatus</i>, which assumes the garb of <i>Harpagus diodon</i> near Rio
  Janeiro.</p>

      &#x215B;-&#x2151;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Gypa&euml;tinae.</i>&ndash;This group apparently links the Vulturidae to the
  Falconidae, but seems nearer to the latter. <i>Gypa&euml;tus barbatus</i>, the magnificent L&auml;mmergeier,
  is greyish-black with white streaks, and has a white crown, cheeks with a black band bifurcating
  at the eye to meet above, and pale tawny lanceolate plumage on the neck and lower parts. Dense
  black bristles cover the nostrils and lores, and a black tuft, which gives the name of Bearded
  Vulture, projects below the mandible. The sclerotic <span class="pagenum" id="page151"><span
  class="smaller">{151}</span></span>membrane is crimson (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page147">147</a></span>). The young are chiefly brown and buff. From Portugal and
  Mauritania this species extends through the lofty mountains of South Europe to the Himalayas and
  North China, though practically exterminated in Switzerland and Carinthia; <i>G. ossifragus</i>
  (<i>meridionalis</i>), with no black stripe below the eye, represents it in North-Eastern and
  Southern Africa. Avoiding its own kin, the L&auml;mmergeier often breeds near Griffon Vultures; the
  large nest of sticks, lined with wool and hair, begun very early in the year, being placed in some
  cavity of a cliff or on a precipitous ledge, and containing one egg&ndash;or rarely
  two&ndash;which appear pale orange owing to the confluent markings. The flight is majestic and
  powerful; the cry weak and querulous, with a croak when irritated. In parts of Spain and India,
  natives assert that this bird preys only on carcases; but in Macedonia it is said to carry off
  lambs, kids, and fowls, and no doubt occasionally it kills small mammals and birds, though all
  statements should be carefully criticised, as it usurps the name of "Grifo" or Griffon in Spain,
  and that of Golden Eagle in India; while conversely any Eagle is pointed out in the Alps as a
  L&auml;mmergeier. It has been credited with a habit of scaring young animals over the cliffs by
  descending with a sudden rush, but its nature is cowardly, and it does not seem to attack man; yet
  marvellous tales have been told of its strength and daring, some of which may in part be true,
  though the evidence is hardly convincing. Like <i>Neophron</i>, it is said to carry bones up into
  the air, letting them fall to break them, while land-tortoises are similarly treated in North
  Africa, and possibly this species is responsible for the death of the poet &AElig;schylus, on whose bare
  head a tortoise is alleged to have been dropped.<a id="NtA_134"
  href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> <i>Gypohierax angolensis</i>, somewhat approaching the
  Vulturidae, is white, with the secondaries, most of the scapulars, the tips of the primaries, and
  the base of the tail black; the bare skin of the sides of the face and the feet are
  flesh-coloured, and the beak is grey-blue. Rare in East and South Africa, though common in the
  West, it is generally seen on lagoons, rivers, or sea-shores, sunning itself on some elevation, or
  skimming the water with laboured flight in search of fish. It will attack animals and eat
  garbage.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Polyborinae.</i>&ndash;Of the American "Carrion Hawks," <i>Polyborus tharus</i>
  is dull black, with whitish neck, back, breast, <span class="pagenum" id="page152"><span
  class="smaller">{152}</span></span>and tail, more or less barred with dusky, and broad blackish
  tips to the rectrices. The bare red skin of the cheeks and throat imparts a vulturine look,
  belied, however, by the almost gallinaceous feet. It inhabits South America from Ecuador and
  Guiana southwards; but thence the very similar <i>P. cheriway</i> ranges to Florida and Lower
  California, <i>P. lutosus</i> occurring in Guadelupe Island off the latter. The Carancho or
  C&aacute;racara, as <i>P. tharus</i> is called, resembles in habits the "Turkey-Buzzards"
  (<i>Rhinogryphus</i>), with which it consorts, though somewhat shy and quarrelsome.
  Semi-gregarious, and audacious if unmolested, it passes the hot hours in the shade, and roosts in
  company at night; while the powerful and graceful flight, with its alternate sailing or flapping
  movements, though not rapid, enables it to soar in spirals to a great altitude. It walks or runs
  with ease. The far-reaching grating note is usually uttered with the head thrown back; the food of
  refuse and carrion is supplemented by young lambs or alligators, birds, frogs, reptiles,
  land-crabs, worms, and insects. When on a tree, bush, or cliff, the large shallow nest, often
  renewed yearly, is made of sticks and lined with grass, leaves, roots, wool, or scraps of any
  sort; but, when on the ground or in swamps, reeds and herbage are commonly utilized. The three or
  four eggs ranging from white with red blotches to cinnamon with a few black marks.</p>

  <p><i>Ibycter</i>, <i>Phalcobaenus</i>, and <i>Senex</i> are kindred Neotropical genera of a
  greenish-black colour, with a variable amount of white on the tail, lower parts, and even the
  wings and nape; the cheeks and throat are naked and red in the first, and orange in the second,
  while the cheeks only are yellow in the third. <i>Phalcobaenus</i> has a slight crest, <i>P.
  carunculatus</i> a fleshy orange caruncle at the base of the bill, <i>Senex</i> rufous thighs.
  <i>Ibycter ater</i> occurs in Amazonia, <i>I. americanus</i> from Guatemala and Honduras to
  Brazil, <i>Phalcobaenus megalopterus</i> from Chili to West Peru, <i>P. carunculatus</i> in
  Ecuador and New Granada, <i>P. albigularis</i> in Patagonia, while <i>Senex australis</i> is the
  "Johnny Rook" of the Falklands. Close allies are <i>Milvago chimachima</i> and <i>M. chimango</i>,
  ranging from Panama to Paraguay, and from about lat. 20&deg; S. to Tierra del Fuego respectively; the
  former is brown, with creamy head, neck, tail, and under-parts, and rectrices barred with brown;
  the latter has the head rufous and black, the lower surface streaky-looking yellowish-brown, the
  tail greyer. The lores and naked orbits are pinkish.</p>

  <p>These forms are similar in manners to <i>Polyborus</i>, but <i>Milvago</i> is <span
  class="pagenum" id="page153"><span class="smaller">{153}</span></span>more terrestrial, and
  chiefly frequents grassy plains; it is moreover less energetic, and has an easy and loitering
  though protracted flight, with a custom of uttering its whistling or mournful notes in chorus, the
  head being thrown back as in the Carancho. The nest of sticks, lined with grass, hair, and wool,
  may be on trees, in grass, or rushes, <i>Senex</i> preferring sea-girt cliffs; the eggs, from two
  to five in number, are cream-coloured, or reddish with darker markings, and vary as in
  <i>Polyborus</i>. Human beings are very rarely molested by "Carrion Hawks," though birds seem to
  fear them greatly.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Accipitrinae.</i>&ndash;First of this group may be placed six genera of
  "Harrier-Eagles," classed as Circa&euml;tinae by the late J. H. Gurney,<a id="NtA_135"
  href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> of which <i>Herpetotheres cachinnans</i>, ranging from South
  Mexico to Bolivia and Paraguay, is the only American representative. It is a crested bird, of a
  brown colour above, relieved by creamy buff, which extends over the whole under surface, the nape
  and face being mostly black. It eats snakes, and sits aloft bobbing its head while uttering a
  gruff "ha-ha." Of the African genus <i>Circa&euml;tus</i> one species, <i>C.
  gallicus</i>&ndash;Jean-le-blanc of the French&ndash;extends from Southern and Central Europe to
  Palestine, India, North China, Timor, and Flores. It is dark brown above, and white with
  blackish-brown streaks and bars below, the secondaries and tail having white tips, and the latter
  three dusky cross-bands. This sluggish but bold denizen of the plains may be seen perched on
  trees, quartering the ground with heavy flapping flight, or anon poising itself aloft on
  motionless wings, the harsh noisy cry being varied by a twittering note. Snakes form its favourite
  food, while frogs and fish from the shallows, small mammals, birds, lizards, crabs, and insects
  add to its daily fare. The bulky nest of sticks, bedded with grass or green leaves, is situated on
  trees, bushes, or even rocky ledges; a single bluish-white egg&ndash;or exceptionally
  two&ndash;being deposited. The female sits very closely, and both parents sometimes attack
  intruders. <i>C. cinereus</i>, of most of the Ethiopian Region, has the chest brownish-black and
  the belly white; <i>C. fasciolatus</i> of Natal, and the similar <i>C. beaudouini</i> of Senegal
  and North-East Africa, have the former part fulvous-brown, and the latter barred with dusky; <i>C.
  cinerascens</i> of the east and west of that continent is much greyer below, with narrower bars.
  <i>Helotarsus ecaudatus</i> of the whole Ethiopian Region is black, with maroon back and tail, and
  a broad grey band across the secondaries; <span class="pagenum" id="page154"><span
  class="smaller">{154}</span></span>the wide crest, short rectrices, red cere, lores and feet,
  rendering it most remarkable. <i>H. leuconotus</i> is hardly more than a creamy-backed variety. It
  sails aloft in powerful style, and dashes like lightning upon the snakes, mammals, and lizards,
  which form its prey; the nest of sticks is placed in trees or rocks, and contains, it is said,
  from two to four white eggs. The crested <i>Eutriorchis</i> of Madagascar, and
  <i>Dryotriorchis</i> of the Gold Coast, short of wing but long of tail, should probably be placed
  here. A fine broad crest also adorns <i>Spilornis</i>, of which genus some seven members occur in
  the Indian Region, and the Celebes group. <i>S. undulatus</i> (<i>cheela</i>), extending from
  India to China, has the head black and white, the remaining plumage brown, with whitish markings
  above, round white spots below, and a broad light band across the white-tipped tail. <i>S.
  sula&euml;nsis</i> of the Sula Islands differs in being barred beneath; <i>S. holospilus</i> of the
  Philippines has the whole body spotted. These arboreal forms live upon snakes, frogs, insects, and
  birds, the last of which they hunt in pairs, converging gradually on the victim from each side:
  the note is mournful; the small nest of twigs, lined with grass or leaves, is placed in trees; the
  two eggs are rufous or white with red markings.</p>

  <p>The slender <i>Polyboro&iuml;des typicus</i>, of most of the Ethiopian Region, combines the
  appearance of a Harrier with that of a typical Hawk; it is grey with white tips to the black
  remiges and rectrices, and shews black and white bars on the lower breast and abdomen. A whitish
  band crosses the tail, while the naked cheeks and cere are yellow. <i>P. radiatus</i> of
  Madagascar is more silvery. Resembling the following group in habits, these birds prefer
  grasslands, especially when newly burnt, take comparatively short flights, and rest more
  frequently on trees or stumps. They are said to be able to bend the tibio-tarsal joint either
  way.</p>

  <p><i>Circus</i>, ranging over nearly the whole world, comprises some seventeen species, in most
  of which the sexes differ in coloration&ndash;an unusual fact in Raptorial forms. They are
  graceful and soft-plumaged, with long legs, wings, and tail, the partial facial ruff creating a
  likeness&ndash;superficial and not warranted by structure&ndash;to the owls. Non-arboreal and by
  nature shy, they may be seen hovering or circling aloft, or systematically beating over the flats
  with buoyant untiring flight, the pinions flapping slowly and regularly, and exposing a broad
  surface to the air. They can, however, move with rapidity, and approach their breeding-quarters
  <span class="pagenum" id="page155"><span class="smaller">{155}</span></span>with a fine downward
  sweep, an exceptionally bold cock sometimes almost striking an intruder. The cry, chiefly heard
  during incubation, is shrill; the food consists mainly of small mammals, but partially of birds,
  reptiles, fish, frogs, insects, or even eggs; the nest, placed among reeds, corn or herbage, in
  gorse-coverts or on heathery or grassy slopes, is, according to circumstances, a pile or layer of
  the surrounding vegetation lined with the finer portions, and contains from three to six
  bluish-white eggs, rarely blotched with rufous. Nesting-sites in trees are on record. Three
  species still breed in Britain, <i>C. cyaneus</i>, the Hen Harrier, <i>C. cineraceus</i>,
  Montagu's Harrier, and <i>C. aeruginosus</i>, the Marsh Harrier or Moor Buzzard. The first two are
  much alike and easily confounded, the female in both being brown above and buffish with dark
  streaks below, while the tail is crossed by five umber bars. The male, which is bluish-grey with
  white rump and abdomen in the Hen Harrier, but is streaked beneath with rufous in the more slender
  Montagu's Harrier, is commonly considered a different species from the female by rustics, who call
  it the "Kite." These forms range over Europe, Asia, and North Africa; but whereas the first-named
  reaches about lat. 69&deg; N. in summer, and occurs from Morocco and Abyssinia to Canton in winter,
  its congener is not found so far north, and migrates down to Cape Colony, Ceylon, and Burma. <i>C.
  aeruginosus</i>, now nearly exterminated in Britain, extends from South Scandinavia and Archangel
  to Japan, and to the Transvaal and Ceylon in the cold season. The upper parts are brown with
  blackish primaries, the remainder of the wings and the tail being grey; the lower surface is buff
  with brownish stripes. Old males have the head nearly cream-coloured, while the irides in the
  female are rather hazel than yellow. The North American <i>C. hudsonius</i> is very near <i>C.
  cyaneus</i>; South America possesses <i>C. cinereus</i>, and, on the east, <i>C. maculosus</i>;
  <i>C. swainsoni</i> reaches from South-East Europe to India and China, with Africa in winter;
  <i>C. ranivorus</i> and <i>C. maurus</i> occupy South Africa; <i>C. spilonotus</i> and <i>C.
  melanoleucus</i> East Asia, the latter being coloured black, white, and grey; <i>C. assimilis</i>
  (<i>jardinii</i>)&ndash;marked with chestnut above, and spotted with white below&ndash;inhabits

  <p><i>Micrastur</i>, a genus found in Central and northern South America, somewhat resembles
  <i>Accipiter</i>, being brown or blackish above, relieved by rufous or grey and white, and white
  or reddish below with or without cross-bars. <i>Geranospizias</i> ranges further south, <i>G.
  caerulescens</i>, which is slaty-blue, with a few white bands beneath, reaching South Brazil and
  Bolivia, while the Central American <i>G. niger</i> is nearly uniform black. The thighs are
  closely feathered, and the tibio-tarsal joint is said to act doubly. Five species of
  <i>Melierax</i> or "Singing Hawk," reside in the Ethiopian Region, especially in the south, where
  <i>M. canorus</i> is plentiful. This form is ash-coloured with black primaries, black and white
  tail, and white belly with greyish bars. The habits are bold, the flight is rapid, the food
  consists of small mammals, birds, reptiles, and locusts. The haunts are in rocky places or bush
  country; the nest of sticks, lined with wool and feathers, is placed in a tree, and contains from
  three to five whitish eggs. The mellow whistling or piping song is heard chiefly in the morning
  and evening, the wide-spread African <i>Asturinula monogrammica</i> alone of the Family vying with
  it in sweetness.</p>

  <p><i>Astur</i> comprises forty or more members, several of which have exact counterparts in the
  genus <i>Accipiter</i>.<a id="NtA_136" href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> The more robust build,
  shorter legs, and stouter toes serve as distinctions; but it must be noted that short wings, long
  legs, and bill without a notch mark all Accipitrine as opposed to Falconine forms. The
  descriptions below will be sufficient to shew the coloration, as the species, except <i>A. novae
  hollandiae</i>, are very similar. Inhabitants of the woodland and river-side, they are nearly
  cosmopolitan, though absent in parts of the Neotropical Region and in New Zealand; while several
  islands have peculiar races. <i>A. palumbarius</i>, the Goshawk, called of old the "Gentle
  Falcon," is now seldom observed in Britain, though once it nested in Scotland; it ranges
  throughout Europe and Asia to Morocco, and thence to the Himalayas and Japan, or slightly further
  south in winter. It is ashy-brown above, with four dark bands on the white-tipped tail, and is
  closely barred with brown and white below. Daring and rapacious, with marvellous power of
  steerage, it follows the abruptest turns of its victims with the greatest ease, gliding after them
  in a low, persistent style, termed by falconers "raking." The food consists of small mammals and
  birds, but <i>A. badius</i> and <i>A. tachiro</i> will eat <span class="pagenum"
  id="page157"><span class="smaller">{157}</span></span>frogs, and the latter limpets; the large
  flat nest of sticks, rarely lined with roots, is placed in trees, the bluish-white eggs, numbering
  from three to five, being occasionally marked with rust-colour. The barely separable North
  American <i>A. atricapillus</i> exhibits very close bars below; the crested <i>A. trivirgatus</i>,
  ranging from India and the Great Sunda Islands to Formosa, is slaty-grey, having a rufous chest, a
  white throat with black median streak, a tail with four brown bands, and white under parts barred
  with rufous and brown; <i>A. badius</i>, the Shikra, extending in its various sub-species from
  Central Russia, Servia, and Greece to China, and many parts of Africa, is blue-grey with five or
  six blackish tail-bands, a less distinct throat-streak, and salmon-coloured lower surface with
  narrow white cross-bars. <i>A. trinotatus</i> of Celebes is blackish-grey, with lighter head,
  white spots on the median rectrices, uniform vinous breast, white throat and vent; the young are
  ferruginous-red above with black markings. Most remarkable of all is <i>A. novae hollandiae</i> of
  Southern Australia and Tasmania&ndash;with its smaller race <i>A. leucosomus</i> of Papuasia and
  the Cape York district&ndash;pure white in colour, with black bill, yellow cere and red irides,
  which some writers consider a permanent albino of <i>A. cinereus</i>. <i>A. hensti</i> and <i>A.
  franciscae</i> are confined to Madagascar, <i>A. brutus</i> and <i>A. pusillus</i> to Mayotte and
  Joanna Islands of the Comoros respectively. <i>Niso&iuml;des moreli</i>, also from Madagascar, a bird
  with stout bill and white irides, closely approaches <i>Astur</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Accipiter</i> is a genus of some thirty species, which rival Goshawks in spirit and daring;
  they inhabit nearly the whole world, but hardly extend to Polynesia. The flight is quick and
  vigorous, with rapid turns; the prey being captured with a dash as the birds skim through the
  wooded country they frequent; while it is subsequently devoured on the ground, as is customary
  among Accipitrine forms. The large flat nest of twigs, occasionally lined with roots or leaves, is
  placed on a tree or rocky ledge; about four to six bluish-white eggs, usually with heavy blotches
  or spots of red-brown, being laid in the central depression. Very puzzling are the changes of
  plumage, though by no means confined to this genus; but the longitudinal spots below in the young
  are said generally to change with age to transverse bars, as is the case in the most typical
  Falcons.<a id="NtA_137" href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

      nisus.</i> (From <i>Poachers</i>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The coloration is well shewn by <i>Accipiter nisus</i>, the Sparrow-Hawk, which breeds
  throughout Europe, North Africa, and Asia north of the Himalayas; extending further south in
  winter, but represented in South Africa by <i>A. rufiventris</i> and <i>A. ovampensis</i> with
  white-spotted rectrices. It is bluish-grey above, with white mottlings on the nape and rufous
  cheeks, the white-tipped tail exhibiting from three to five dark bands, and the buffish-white
  under parts red-brown bars. Other species are blacker or browner, or more rufous below; <i>A.
  rubricollis</i> and <i>A. erythrauchen</i> of the Moluccas have the nape red; the latter, <i>A.
  rhodogaster</i> of Celebes, <i>A. virgatus</i> of India and East Asia (including <i>A.
  niso&iuml;des</i>), <i>A. hartlaubi</i> of the Gaboon, and <i>A. ventralis</i> of Venezuela, Colombia,
  and Ecuador, have nearly uniform ruddy under parts; <i>A. erythrocnemis</i> of Brazil and Bolivia,
  and <i>A. chionogaster</i>, ranging from Guatemala to Venezuela are almost white beneath; <i>A.
  bicolor</i> of Central and South America having grey-blue for the white. <i>A. melanoleucus</i> of
  North-East, West, and South Africa is deep black, with brown bars on the rectrices, and some white
  on the <span class="pagenum" id="page159"><span class="smaller">{159}</span></span>tail-coverts
  and breast; <i>A. pectoralis</i> of Brazil is brownish-black above, slightly relieved by white,
  the tail being greyish with black bands, the collar and chest rufous, the fore-neck and abdomen
  white, streaked and barred respectively with black. <i>A. minullus</i> inhabits South Africa,
  <i>A. madagascariensis</i> Madagascar, <i>A. cirrocephalus</i> Australia, Tasmania, and Papuasia,
  <i>A. chilensis</i> Chili, <i>A. guttatus</i> Paraguay and Bolivia, <i>A. pileatus</i> Brazil,
  <i>A. collaris</i> New Granada; while the very robust <i>A. cooperi</i> occupies North America
  southwards to Mexico, and <i>A. fuscus</i> the same country to Panama. In <i>A. subniger</i>
  (<i>tinus</i>), of Central and South America, and some other species, the young are red above.
  <i>Erythrotriorchis radiatus</i> of East and Central Australia, a rufous bird with dark markings,
  which lays an egg like that of a Sparrow-Hawk, may perhaps be placed here, as may <i>Megatriorchis
  doriae</i> of New Guinea, in which the blackish upper parts have lighter transverse stripes, and
  the white under parts longitudinal dusky streaks.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 4. <i>Aquilinae.</i>&ndash;The long-legged <i>Morphnus guianensis</i>, ranging from
  Panama to Amazonia, is black, with three ashy tail-bars, brown head and chest, and white
  rufous-banded abdomen; the fine crest is brown with black tip, the wing- and tail-coverts are
  varied with white. This bird haunts thick woods near water, and in habits appears to resemble the
  next two genera, which have similar soft plumage, short wings and long tails. <i>M. taeniatus</i>
  of Ecuador has broader and blacker bars below. <i>Harpyopsis novae guineae</i> of New Guinea, and
  <i>Thrasa&euml;tus harpyia</i>, the Harpy, extending from Mexico, to Paraguay and Bolivia, have
  blackish-grey upper parts with a tendency to darker transverse markings; the tail shews six black
  bars; and the white under parts exhibit a greyish zone on the chest. The former species is,
  moreover, relieved by white above, while a bifurcated grey crest surmounts the white head and neck
  of the latter. Marvellous stories have been told of the fierceness and strength of the last-named,
  but despite its huge bill and legs, it seems never to attack man, though defending itself with
  spirit when wounded. Found in low-lying forests and near rivers, it may be seen wheeling in
  circles with slow heavy flight, or digesting its meals on low boughs of trees. The diet consists
  largely of mammals, including fawns, monkeys, foxes and peccaries; the nest is in high trees or
  cliffs. The Indians are very proud of a living specimen, while the down is used for decoration,
  and the feathers for arrow-making. <i>Harpyopsis</i> devours wallabies.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page160"><span class="smaller">{160}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Pithecophaga jefferyi</i>, a fine forest Eagle from the Philippines, with extremely deep and
  compressed bill, seems to belong here.<a id="NtA_138" href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The true Eagles&ndash;fierce but seldom courageous&ndash;inhabit wild mountains, plains, or
  forests; resembling Buzzards in their slow heavy flight, and rarely uttering their shrill cry or
  yelp. The prey is generally secured by a pounce; and carrion, if fairly fresh, is eaten. The nest
  of sticks or twigs, lined with grass, green foliage, fur or wool, especially the two first,
  contains from one to three large white eggs, with or without red or brownish markings.</p>

  <p>The various species of <i>Spiza&euml;tus</i>, <i>Limna&euml;tus</i>, <i>Lophotriorchis</i>,
  <i>Lophoa&euml;tus</i>, <i>Neopus</i>, and <i>Nisa&euml;tus</i>, with comparatively short wings, long tails,
  and large claws, are sometimes denominated Hawk-Eagles. Not usually shy, they are essentially
  denizens of wooded country, where some prefer the hilly districts, others the neighbourhood of
  streams; the food is extremely varied, including in different cases, monkeys, bucks, lambs, goats,
  hares, rabbits, birds as large as bustards and geese, lizards, frogs, or even fish; while the
  flight is more graceful and Falcon-like than in the genus <i>Aquila</i>, the note clearer and
  sharper. The moderately large nest is composed of sticks, and usually lined with green leaves or
  branchlets; the one or two eggs are white, ordinarily with light reddish-brown markings.
  <i>Spiza&euml;tus coronatus</i> of South and West Africa is blackish above, with a little white on the
  tail-coverts and remiges, and brownish tips to the triply-barred rectrices, the buff lower parts
  being broadly banded with black. <i>S. tyrannus</i>, extending from Guatemala to Brazil, is black
  beneath; <i>S. ornatus</i>, of Central and South America as far as Paraguay, has the nape and
  sides of the neck and chest tawny. These birds have an occipital crest, as have some members of
  the hardly separable <i>Limna&euml;tus</i>, of which <i>L. caligatus</i>, of India and the Malay
  countries, deep brown in colour, with ashy inner webs to the remiges, will serve as an example.
  <i>L. nipalensis</i> and <i>L. cirrhatus</i> inhabit India with Ceylon, and the former Formosa and
  Japan; <i>L. philippensis</i> the Philippines; <i>L. alboniger</i> Malacca and Borneo; <i>L.
  lanceolatus</i> Celebes and the Sula Islands; <i>L. gurneyi</i> New Guinea and the Moluccas;
  <i>L.</i> (<i>Lophotriorchis</i>) <i>kieneri</i> India, Malacca, Borneo, and Batchian; <i>L.
  isidori</i> north-western South America. <i>Lophoa&euml;tus occipitalis</i>, of Africa south of the
  Sahara, is brown, except for a few white marks above, and has shortly-feathered white metatarsi.
  <span class="pagenum" id="page161"><span class="smaller">{161}</span></span>Here the crest is
  extremely long, but in the nearly black <i>Neopus malayensis</i>, ranging from India to the
  Moluccas, it is much shorter. <i>Spiziastur melanoleucus</i>, extending from Guatemala to Brazil,
  is brownish-black, with white head, neck, and lower surface, the tail has four darker bands, and
  black marks shew towards the crest. In this species the inner claw and hallux are greatly
  developed. <i>Nisa&euml;tus pennatus</i>, the "Booted Eagle" of South Europe, Africa, and thence to
  India and Ceylon, so called from the feathered legs, is brown above, with a white shoulder-patch,
  white tip to the barred tail, and various buffish markings; the head, neck, and under parts are
  fawn-coloured, with brown streaks except on the abdomen. <i>N. fasciatus</i>, Bonelli's Eagle, has
  a similar range, but reaches China, and not South Africa; it lacks the shoulder-patch, but is
  streaked on the abdomen. <i>N. morphno&iuml;des</i> inhabits Australia and New Guinea, <i>N.
  spilogaster</i> and <i>N. bellicosus</i> Southern Africa, the last being slaty-black above, and
  having a plain brown chest.</p>

  <p>The typical Eagle, the bird of Jove, the emblem of Rome and of St. John, was some species of
  <i>Aquila</i>. <i>A. chrysa&euml;tus</i>, the Golden or Black Eagle, is exceptionally shot in England
  in winter&ndash;especially in the north; but it is the Sea Eagle that occurs most frequently. In
  North Britain the former has bred in increasing numbers since protection has been given in
  deer-forests, where it kills the grouse which startle the stalker's game; a few pairs remain in
  North and West Ireland; while in times past it ranged to the Peak of Derbyshire or even Snowdon.
  Abroad it occupies most of Europe, North Asia to India and China, North Africa, and North America
  to Mexico. Powerful and fierce by nature, and ready to attack animals of considerable size, it
  never molests man under ordinary circumstances; both parents, it is true, circle anxiously round
  when the young are in danger, but should the nest contain eggs, the hen, which sits closely,
  vanishes at once on leaving them. She does not reappear until all risk seems past, while the cock
  is seldom sighted at the eyry, though usually seen in the vicinity. The prey consists of
  antelopes, wolves, foxes, fawns, lambs, hares, rabbits, marmots, geese, ducks, grouse, and so
  forth, with carrion, if sufficiently fresh; the ground is often quartered at a low elevation, and
  wonderfully rapid in the chase is the flight of this apparently slow and ponderous bird, aided by
  its extraordinarily keen powers of vision. Solitary individuals may occasionally be approached by
  stalking, but in Britain they are generally wary, owing to constant <span class="pagenum"
  id="page162"><span class="smaller">{162}</span></span>disturbance; they may, however, often be
  seen circling aloft or winging their way to great distances, while they can hardly be
  distinguished from Buzzards in misty weather even by experienced keepers. Captures are made with
  the talons, but Eagles are comparatively seldom trained for Falconry; yet the present species has
  been so used in Europe, as well as by the Kirgiz Tartars, who call it "Bergut" or "Bearcoot." The
  cry is shrill and yelping. The nest is commonly placed in a tree, though in Scotland such sites
  are seldom utilized nowadays, a projecting rock on the side of some bare mountain-glen or a
  sea-girt crag being selected instead. Here a cavity, rather than a ledge, is chosen, and a huge
  mass of sticks or heather is collected, with a bedding of hair, fur, wool, moss, dry fern and an
  occasional feather, or more commonly of tufts of <i>Luzula sylvatica</i>, garnished with an odd
  pine-shoot. Two or three eyries are often used in turn, the pile increasing on each occasion. At
  times the spot can be reached without a rope by a skilful climber, and in some countries nests
  have been found upon the ground. The two or three eggs&ndash;four being quite
  exceptional&ndash;are generally marked with red-brown, crimson, purplish or grey, but, though fine
  blotches are usual, one if not more of the set is frequently white. They are laid very early in
  spring and&ndash;as in other Birds of Prey&ndash;not always on successive days. The Golden Eagle
  is distinguished from the Sea-Eagle (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page163">163</a></span>) by
  the feathering reaching to the toes, which have only the last joint scutellated, and the remainder
  reticulated: the adult is normally blackish-brown, with tawny lanceolate nape-plumes and tail
  mottled with grey; the young have white bases to the rectrices. The colour, however, varies
  much.</p>

  <p><i>Aquila clanga</i>, the Spotted Eagle of British lists, and its smaller form, <i>A.
  pomarina</i>, range across Europe, except the most northern portions, and extend to North Africa,
  India, and North China, their respective distributions being somewhat uncertain. The colour is
  brown, with pale nape and light margins to the feathers of the wings and rump; the manners are
  those of Eagles generally, but the food includes frogs, reptiles, and grasshoppers, in addition to
  small mammals and birds. <i>A. hastata</i> of India is hardly separable, and the African <i>A.
  wahlbergi</i> is very similar, as is the larger <i>A. nipalensis</i>, the Steppe Eagle of the
  former country, Eastern Europe, Eastern Asia, and, exceptionally, North Africa, a plain brown bird
  with a fulvous nuchal patch. It commonly builds its nest <span class="pagenum" id="page163"><span
  class="smaller">{163}</span></span>upon the ground. <i>A. adalberti</i>, the White-shouldered
  Eagle of Portugal, Spain, and North-West Africa&ndash;often wrongly called "Imperial,"&ndash;preys
  upon lizards, snakes, hares and rabbits, which it usually spies from a perch on some bare
  tree-top. It is black, with brownish neck, greyish base to the tail, and a broad white
  shoulder-patch, whereas <i>A. mogilnik</i>, the true Imperial Eagle, ranging from Central Europe
  and North-East Africa to India and China, differs in having the head and neck creamy yellow, and
  only the scapulars white. <i>A. rapax</i> (<i>naevio&iuml;des</i>), the Tawny Eagle of most of Africa,
  rarely found in Europe, is remarkable for the parti-coloured feathers of purplish-brown and rufous
  on the upper parts; otherwise it is brown, slightly streaked with fulvous below. The smaller <i>A.
  vindhiana</i> and <i>A. fulvescens</i> of India are very like it, while <i>A. verreauxi</i> of
  Abyssinia and South Africa is jet black with white rump and lower back. <i>Uroa&euml;tus audax</i> of
  Australia and Tasmania is black, and has a wedge-shaped tail, the bright chestnut nape being
  streaked with black, and the head with white.</p>

  <p>Of the Sea Eagles, characterized by very large bills and nearly bare metatarsi, the biggest is
  the fish-eating <i>Thalassa&euml;tus pelagicus</i>, brown in colour, with white cuneate tail, rump,
  thighs, and patch on the wing-coverts. It inhabits the coasts, lakes, and rivers of North East
  Asia, the Liu-Kiu Islands and Japan, rarely wandering to America. <i>T. branickii</i> of Corea is
  slaty-black, with only the tail and its coverts white. <i>Halia&euml;tus albicilla</i>, the Erne or
  Sea-Eagle, of which a few pairs remain in Shetland and the west of Scotland and Ireland, used to
  breed at least as far south in England as the Isle of Man and the Lake District, while in winter
  immature or even adult specimens still frequently occur in various parts. Generally distributed
  over the Old World from Greenland to Kamtschatka, it breeds also in the Danube valley, Turkey,
  Greece, and Egypt, migrating to the Canary Islands, North Africa, Japan, China, and occasionally
  the Commander Islands. It is brown with white tail, the full plumage not being attained for nearly
  six years; but very old examples become whitish on the head and neck. In most of its habits it
  resembles the Golden Eagle, though the note is shriller, and the food consists largely of fish,
  seized in the talons as it swoops down; it is said to be very destructive to lambs, and, as it
  eats carrion, it is readily poisoned. In Britain the eyries are now in precipitous sea-cliffs, but
  of old inland rocks and trees were utilized, as is the case abroad, while <span class="pagenum"
  id="page164"><span class="smaller">{164}</span></span>in Egypt nests have been found upon the
  ground in marshes; the two or three white eggs, laid early in the year, are rarely marked with
  rufous. The representative American species <i>H. leucocephalus</i>, the Bald Eagle, has the head,
  neck, rump, and tail white, and ranges from the North to California and Mexico. <i>H.
  leucocoryphus</i>, with the middle of the tail and the cheeks white, extends from South-East
  Europe to East Siberia, China, and Burma; <i>H. leucogaster</i>, a greyer bird with white head,
  neck, under parts, and end of the tail, occurs from India and China to Australia and the Friendly
  Islands; <i>H. vocifer</i> with white head, neck, breast, and tail, but chestnut belly, occupies
  the Ethiopian Region; <i>H. vocifero&iuml;des</i> of Madagascar is intermediate between the last-named
  and <i>H. leucocoryphus</i>. The river-haunting <i>Polioa&euml;tus ichthya&euml;tus</i>, of the Indian
  Region and Celebes, is brown, with grey head and neck, white abdomen and tail, the latter broadly
  tipped with brown; <i>P. plumbeus</i>, of similar range, lacks the white base of the tail. The
  huge nest is placed in a tree and is often lined with green leaves, the two or three eggs being
  white; the note is loud and plaintive, and the food consists chiefly of fish.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 5. <i>Buteoninae</i>, or Buzzards and Kites.&ndash;In this group the Rough-legged
  Buzzards (<i>Archibuteo</i>) are separated from the genus <i>Buteo</i> on account of their
  feathered metatarsi. <i>A. lagopus</i>, well-known in Britain from the numbers which frequently
  appear in autumn, is alleged to have bred once in Yorkshire, while in Northern Europe it is
  common, extending thence to about the Lena in Asia, and migrating in winter to South Europe,
  Turkestan, and even Natal. At the same season a darker sub-species <i>A. sancti johannis</i>,
  which breeds north of the United States, occurs southwards to Mexico. The former bird is
  cream-coloured, with brown markings of various depth, becoming more streaky below; the tail shews
  a white base and three or four dark cross-bars, of which the sub-terminal is very broad. In
  Scandinavia, when there is a plague of lemmings, it is as valuable an ally as the owls; the habits
  being identical with those of <i>Buteo</i>. <i>A. ferrugineus</i> of western North America has the
  upper surface and thighs ferruginous with brown streaks, the head, neck, and tail whiter, and the
  under parts nearly pure white. <i>A. hemiptilopus</i> (<i>strophiatus</i>) of Nepal and Tibet is
  nearly uniform brown with a white pectoral band.</p>

  <p><i>Buteo</i> is a genus of some thirty species, which together inhabit nearly the whole globe,
  except the Australian region; the <span class="pagenum" id="page165"><span
  class="smaller">{165}</span></span>only form thence recorded seeming to be <i>B. solitarius</i> of
  the Sandwich Archipelago&ndash;the <i>Pandion solitarius</i> of Cassin and so-called <i>Onychotes
  gruberi</i> of Mr. Ridgway. All may be represented both in appearance and manners by <i>B.
  vulgaris</i>, the Common Buzzard, which breeds not uncommonly in a few wild districts of Britain,
  chiefly towards the west, and is found on migration in other parts. Abroad the range includes the
  Atlantic Islands, West and Central Europe, whence it strays at times to Eastern Europe, Asia
  Minor, and North Africa; the resident bird of those countries, however, is <i>B. desertorum</i>.
  The colour above is brown, with slight white marks and twelve dusky bars on the tail, the lower
  surface being yellowish-white with brown streaks; but varieties are very frequent in the genus,
  and these may be either darker or exhibit creamy tints, a trimorphic tendency of which the
  Sandwich Islands form is a notable instance. The English name Puttock and the Welsh Cetn appear to
  be applied indiscriminately to the Common Buzzard and the Kite. The flight is powerful, though
  slow and heavy, nor is it uncommon to see individuals circling in the air or poising themselves
  aloft on motionless wings; when quartering the ground the movements are not unlike those of
  Harriers, but the style is more steady, and the operations less protracted. Much of the food
  consists of small mammals, and especially rodents; it includes, however, small birds, reptiles,
  frogs, beetles, and grasshoppers; and many gamekeepers now recognise the bird's utility by
  protecting its breeding-quarters. Its congener <i>B. jakal</i> is even more useful, and destroys
  large or venomous snakes. Furthermore, the custom of darting upon the prey from some post of
  vantage remains to be noticed. The nest, commonly situated in trees, is equally often in rocks;
  those selected not being necessarily lofty, but frequently mere outcrops on the sides of
  hill-valleys, in which case access is easy even without a rope. The materials used are much the
  same as in the case of the Golden Eagle, but finer; a like fancy being shewn for green foliage,
  though ivy and so forth take the place of pine-shoots, as being more readily obtainable. The eggs
  are white or greenish, commonly blotched or spotted to a greater or less extent with dark brown,
  red, or lilac; the hen sits very closely, the cock meanwhile soaring above the intruder's head,
  and uttering his characteristic cat-like mew. <i>B. desertorum</i>, of all Africa, South-East
  Europe, and the countries to India inclusive, which has been <span class="pagenum"
  id="page166"><span class="smaller">{166}</span></span>recorded three times in England, is smaller
  and more decidedly rufous than <i>B. vulgaris</i>, though hardly distinguishable when immature;
  while the bigger <i>B. ferox</i> of similar range, though apparently limited in Africa to the
  North, is closely allied; as are <i>B. plumipes</i>, extending from India to Japan (of which <i>B.
  leucocephalus</i> is a large and probably distinct form) and <i>B. swainsoni</i> of North America,
  which migrates as far south as Patagonia, and has almost uniform upper parts and chest. <i>B.
  borealis</i>, the "Red-tailed Hawk," occupying with its various races the whole of North America,
  has a rufous tail with lighter tip and usually a single blackish band, the breast being
  sooty-black or white, with or without a reddish tinge; <i>B. albicaudatus</i>, reaching from Texas
  to Brazil, is slaty-grey, with rusty markings on the mantle, white under parts and tail, the
  latter showing grey bars and a wide subterminal black cross-belt; while <i>B. abbreviatus</i>,
  found from the southern United States to northern South America, is almost black, with three broad
  grey and white zones across the rectrices. <i>B. augur</i> and <i>B. auguralis</i>, both from
  North-East and West Africa, with <i>B. jakal</i> of South Africa, have the upper parts black, some
  grey on the wings, and the tail chestnut except near the end. The first has a black throat with
  white streaks and white lower surface, the second a red-brown chest and black spots on the belly,
  the third is black below with a whitish pectoral patch. Finally, omitting several American species
  from want of space, <i>B. brachypterus</i>&ndash;a miniature Common Buzzard&ndash;is peculiar to
  Madagascar, <i>B. galapagensis</i> to the Galapagos, <i>B. exsul</i> to Masafuera, <i>B.
  poliosomus</i> to Chili, Patagonia, and the Falklands.</p>

  <p><i>Parabuteo unicinctus</i>, ranging from the southern United States to Chili and Argentina, a
  sluggish carrion eater, is sooty-brown with rufous on the wing-coverts and thighs, and a white
  base and tip to the tail. <i>Buteola brachyura</i> and <i>B. leucorrhoa</i> of tropical America,
  separated from <i>Buteo</i> by a central tubercle in the nostril, are black above; the former
  being white below and having four dark bars on the ashy tail, the latter only shewing white at the
  base of the black rectrices, which are crossed by one grey bar.</p>

  <p><i>Asturina</i>, placed near <i>Astur</i> by some authors, includes two species with
  Buzzard-like habits, that build slight nests and lay greenish-white eggs. <i>A. plagiata</i>,
  found from the South-West United States to Panama, is grey, barred with black on the primaries and
  with white below, while a white median band <span class="pagenum" id="page167"><span
  class="smaller">{167}</span></span>crosses the rectrices, of which the coverts are black and
  white. <i>A. nitida</i>, reaching from Panama to south-east Brazil, differs in having white bars
  above. <i>Rupornis magnirostris</i> of Colombia, Guiana, and Amazonia&ndash;hardly separable from
  <i>Asturina</i>&ndash;has three black belts on the tail and is rufous instead of grey beneath;
  <i>R. ruficauda</i> of Central America, <i>R. pucherani</i> of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina,
  and its Bolivian race <i>R. saturata</i>, have the chestnut remiges and rufous rectrices crossed
  with blackish, and the under surface as in the first-named, but the second is browner and shows a
  creamy patch on the primaries; <i>R. nattereri</i>, of Peru and Brazil, combines the chestnut
  primaries with an ashy and black tail; <i>R. ridgwayi</i>, of Haiti, is chiefly rufous and brown
  above, and slate-coloured with white bands below. <i>R. pucherani</i> is very noisy and eats
  fish.</p>

  <p><i>Butastur teesa</i> (with its sub-species <i>indicus</i>) ranges from Japan and China to New
  Guinea and India; it is reddish-brown, varied with white on the nape and rump, the tail and lower
  parts being rufous, with black and white bars respectively. <i>B. liventer</i>, found from Burma
  to Celebes, is ashy below; <i>B. rufipennis</i> of North-East Africa, has streaks in place of
  bars. The pugnacious Indian form has a mewing cry, feeds upon small mammals, lizards, frogs, and
  crabs, and builds its nest almost entirely of twigs, laying some three bluish-white eggs.
  <i>Geranoa&euml;tus melanoleucus</i> of western and southern South America, the so-called Chilian
  "Sea-Eagle," is black with grey wings and white belly, both barred with dusky; the flight is
  vulturine with spiral gyrations, the note is piercing; the food consists of carrion from the
  beach, small mammals, birds, and grasshoppers. The nest, placed in a tree or crag, is composed of
  sticks and grass, the two white eggs being blotched with pale red. It is often seen inland.</p>

  <p><i>Leucopternis</i> is a genus of eleven members, of which <i>L. ghiesbreghti</i>, of Central
  America, is snowy-white, with most of the wings and a zone on the tail black. The other forms,
  whereof three inhabit Brazil, are black or slate-coloured above with white markings, the lower
  surface being grey in <i>L. plumbea</i> of Ecuador and Panama and <i>L. schistacea</i> of Colombia
  and Amazonia, but barred with black and white in <i>L. princeps</i>, of Costa Rica. <i>Urubitinga
  zonura</i>, a black bird with white tip and base to the tail, ranges from Mexico to Chili and
  Argentina; <span class="pagenum" id="page168"><span class="smaller">{168}</span></span><i>U.
  anthracina</i>, found from Arizona and Texas to northern South America, has in addition a white
  belt across the rectrices.</p>

  <p>The crested <i>Harpyhalia&euml;tus coronatus</i>, extending from Bolivia and Brazil to Patagonia, a
  powerful and savage bird with a taste for carrion, is chocolate-brown, with grey on the wing, and
  a tail like that of the last species; <i>H. solitarius</i>, darker in colour and doubtfully
  distinct, reaching Mexico northwards. <i>Heterospizias meridionalis</i>, of northern South America
  to Bolivia and Paraguay, is mottled with rufous, grey, and black, and has two white bands on the
  tail. <i>Buteogallus aequinoctialis</i>, of Guiana and Colombia, is black relieved with rusty
  above, and reddish with black bars below, the remiges being chiefly chestnut, and the tail
  indistinctly barred with white. <i>Busarellus nigricollis</i>, of Guiana and Brazil, is brighter
  chestnut with black streaks, the head being buffish, the lower throat, primaries, and most of the
  tail black. It has a harsh cry, and loves sitting on stumps near water, while the rugose soles of
  the feet assist it to secure the fishes and molluscs on which it&ndash;as well as
  <i>Buteogallus</i>&ndash;feeds.</p>

  <p>Of the forms with comparatively weaker feet, <i>Haliastur indus</i>, the "Brahminy Kite" or
  "Pondicherry Eagle," reaching from the Indian Region to Australia and New Guinea, is chestnut with
  darker wings, the white head, neck, and lower parts being streaked with black; <i>H.
  sphenurus</i>, of the two latter countries and New Caledonia, named by colonists the "Whistling
  Kite," is ashy-brown, with rufous head and ochraceous breast striped with brown. The note is
  shrill, the flight easy and buoyant, the food composed of garbage, small mammals, birds, lizards,
  frogs, crustaceans, insects and their larvae; while fish are secured by grasping them with one
  foot during gliding movements along the surface of the water. The Australian species attacks
  poultry, but is of great utility in devouring caterpillars during insect-plagues. The nest of
  twigs, lined with grass, roots, hair, or green leaves, is adorned with rags and the like, the two
  or three eggs being greenish-white, rarely with rusty markings.</p>

  <p><i>Milvus ictinus</i>, the Red Kite or Fork-tailed Glead of the Old World, ranging from the
  Atlantic Islands&ndash;except, perhaps, the Azores&ndash;through most of Europe to Palestine, Asia
  Minor, and Northern Africa, but leaving the northerly districts in autumn, is red-brown above and
  rusty-red beneath, the lower surface and the whitish head being streaked with dark brown.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is still known to breed in certain parts of Northern and Western Britain, though no longer
  the ubiquitous scavenger of the streets, so common even in London three or four centuries ago.
  Bold thefts of poultry from farmyards and linen from drying-grounds then counterbalanced its
  utility, but none the less may we regret the almost total extermination of this fine tenant of the
  air, caused by the increase of fire-arms and the discovery that its tail-feathers make the
  choicest salmon-flies. Not unlike a Buzzard when aloft, the shrill whistling note, when heard,
  constitutes a clear mark of distinction; while the broad wings and long deeply-forked tail bestow
  such graceful ease of motion and perfect steerage power as few birds can claim, whether for
  soaring and circling aloft, quartering the ground for booty, or hovering over the water to fish.
  It is not always, however, that the forked character of the tail is apparent, for when fully open
  it looks square, just as a square tail seems rounded. This species <span class="pagenum"
  id="page170"><span class="smaller">{170}</span></span>is somewhat gregarious and sluggish, and
  feeds on offal, small mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects and their larvae. The
  nest is a mass of sticks, rags, paper, and rubbish generally, placed in a tree or rarely in a
  rock; the three, or exceptionally four, eggs being like those of the Buzzard, but duller and with
  more lilac tints. <i>Milvus migrans</i>, the Black Kite, once recorded in England, extends
  throughout Central and Southern Europe, and probably to China, breeding in North-Western and
  migrating to Southern Africa. The upper parts are dark brown, the under parts rufous, and the head
  whitish, the two latter being streaked with dusky; the bill is black and the tail moderately
  forked. Barely separable from this bird are <i>Milvus aegyptius</i> of Africa, Madagascar,
  South-East Europe, and West Asia, with yellow bill; <i>M. affinis</i>, of Papuasia and Australia,
  possibly reaching Ceylon; <i>M. melanotis</i>, extending from India to Lake Baikal, China, and
  Japan; and the smaller <i>M. govinda</i> of somewhat similar range. The third and fourth have a
  white patch beneath the primaries. The last-named, or Pariah Kite, is the scavenger of Hindostan,
  and is even bolder than its congeners; the habits, however, are similar, as are those of the
  Australian <i>Lophoictinia isura</i>, separated from <i>Milvus</i> on account of its square tail.
  This species has a fine crest, and differs, moreover, in its browner crown and greyer rectrices
  with whitish coverts.</p>

  <p><i>Gypoictinia melanosternon</i> of Australia has a black head and lower surface, chestnut
  occiput, nape, and thighs, and brownish- or rufous-black upper parts, the wings and rounded tail
  being marked with greyish white. Like a Kite in manners, it eats snakes and lizards, and is said
  to destroy Bustard's and Emeu's eggs.<a id="NtA_139" href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a>
  <i>Elano&iuml;des furcatus</i>, the lovely Swallow-tailed Kite, caught once in England, and ranging
  from the Middle United States to Brazil, is black, with purple and green reflexions, white head,
  neck, rump, inner secondaries and under parts, bluish bill and feet. With splendid powers of wing,
  it may be seen gliding rapidly through the air, skilfully quartering the ground, or circling aloft
  with its long forked tail outspread, to perform doublings and evolutions of every description. It
  catches bees or other insects in one claw and eats them as it flies, or snatches up a lizard,
  snake, or frog, to be devoured at leisure, small birds and grubs varying the diet. Flocks are
  often seen, which <span class="pagenum" id="page171"><span class="smaller">{171}</span></span>hang
  round a wounded individual like Terns. In the nest and eggs this species and the last resemble
  their kin, though using no rubbish in building. <i>Nauclerus riocouri</i>, of inter-tropical
  Africa, a miniature <i>Elano&iuml;des</i>, is grey, with white face and lower surface.</p>

  <p><i>Gampsonyx swainsoni</i>, of Trinidad, Guiana, Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, is grey, with
  yellow face, white collar, under parts and tips to the secondaries; a black patch relieving each
  side of the breast and one of red the upper back. The tail is rounded in this and the succeeding
  genus. <i>Elanus caeruleus</i>, the Black-winged Kite, straying to South-West Europe, but properly
  ranging from the South-East to India, Ceylon, and all Africa, is ashy-grey above with a black
  patch on the wing-coverts; the face, lateral rectrices, and all the lower plumage being white, and
  the irides red. A sub-species, <i>E. hypoleucus</i>, occupies Borneo, Java, the Philippines, and
  Celebes. <i>E. scriptus</i> of Australia, <i>E. axillaris</i>, extending thence to Java, and the
  hardly separable <i>E. leucurus</i> of tropical and sub-tropical America, are marked with black on
  the under wing-coverts, while the first has black axillaries also. These buoyant birds are fond of
  perching, but soar with ease, quartering the plains like Harriers, or hovering with uplifted wings
  to dart down upon their prey of insects, snakes, small mammals, and more rarely birds. The cry is
  mournful; the small nest, of sticks, grass, and moss, is placed in trees; the three, four, or even
  eight white eggs being heavily blotched with red. <i>Ictinia mississippiensis</i>, the Mississippi
  Kite, found from the Southern United States to Guatemala, and represented from Mexico to Paraguay
  by the black-winged <i>I. plumbea</i>, is lead-coloured, with black notched tail and rufous inner
  webs to the primaries; its manners correspond to those of <i>Elano&iuml;des</i>, but the eggs are
  white.</p>

  <p>That most abnormal form <i>Rostrhamus sociabilis</i>, the Awl-billed or Everglade Kite, ranging
  from Florida and Cuba to Bolivia and Argentina, is slaty-black, with white base and tip to the
  brownish emarginate tail, orange cere and feet, and crimson irides. The extraordinarily slender
  bill with long terminal hook no doubt assists greatly in extracting from their shells the
  molluscs, such as <i>Ampullaria</i>, on which this species entirely subsists, while its long legs
  and sharp talons help to secure the prey in the muddy swamps it frequents. Mr. Gibson<a
  id="NtA_140" href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> tells us that it is to some extent gregarious,
  and is often seen slowly beating over the <span class="pagenum" id="page172"><span
  class="smaller">{172}</span></span>marshes, or poised aloft with its broad expanded tail alone in
  motion, a "creaking" or "neighing" alarm-note being apparently the only cry. Twenty or thirty
  nests are commonly built close together, and are slight platforms of twigs or plant-stems, with a
  lining of aquatic herbage, supported on the reeds or bushes a few feet above the water. The two or
  three eggs are whitish with reddish- or yellowish-brown and grey blotches. The breeding-quarters
  are constantly changed.</p>

  <p><i>Machaerorhamphus alcinus</i>, of Tenasserim, Malacca, Borneo, Sumatra, and New Guinea, is
  especially remarkable for the wide gape of the short bill, which recalls that of the
  Caprimulgidae. All the tail-coverts are unusually elongated, a fine crest of pointed feathers
  adorns the occiput, and the plumage is black with a chocolate tinge, the throat and middle of the
  chest being white, with a broad black streak down the former. <i>M. anderssoni</i>, of
  Damara-Land, the Cameroons, and Madagascar, known to have crepuscular tendencies and to feed
  partly on bats, is smaller, and has a white abdomen; <i>M. revoili</i>, of Somali-Land, is
  intermediate.</p>

  <p><i>Pernis apivorus</i>, the Honey-Buzzard, which still breeds occasionally in Britain in June,
  when the dense foliage easily causes it to be overlooked, inhabits Europe generally, and probably
  extends to Japan, migrating in winter to Madagascar and South Africa. The extremely complex phases
  of plumage make it uncertain whether it shares the Indian Region with the similar but crested
  <i>P. ptilorhynchus</i> (<i>cristatus</i>), from which <i>P. tweeddalii</i>, of Sumatra, is
  doubtfully separable. The upper parts are brown, with greyish head and three or four dark bands on
  the tail, the lower white with brown spots and bars. White mottlings usually shew above, and the
  female has the crown brown. The shortly-feathered lores distinguish <i>Pernis</i> from
  <i>Buteo</i>. Our woodland species feeds upon the ground, and devours bees, wasps, and
  grubs&ndash;though not honey&ndash;from the comb, together with small mammals, birds, slugs, and
  worms; the cry is shrill, but seldom heard; the nest, composed of sticks lined with leaves,
  contains two or three whitish eggs with rich purplish-red or brown markings. <i>P. celebensis</i>
  differs in the rufous chest, which exhibits black streaks, that are continued to the white throat
  with its black longitudinal band; the adult closely resembles <i>Limna&euml;tus lanceolatus</i>, both
  being peculiar to Celebes. <i>Henicopernis longicaudatus</i>, of Papuasia, is brown barred with
  black above, and white streaked with blackish below, <span class="pagenum" id="page173"><span
  class="smaller">{173}</span></span>the tail shewing five black bands; <i>H. infuscatus</i>, of New
  Britain, is a darker race. <i>Regerhinus uncinatus</i>, and the larger <i>R. megarhynchus</i>,
  found from Central America to Bolivia and Brazil, are dusky slate-coloured with a white tail-bar;
  <i>R. wilsoni</i>, of Cuba, has a yellow bill; <i>R.</i> (<i>Leptodon</i>) <i>cayennensis</i> is
  glossy black, with grey head, wing and tail-bands, and white lower surface. Immature birds are
  brown, with rufous and white streaks or bars below.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 6. <i>Falconinae.</i>&ndash;The true Falcons are remarkable for a notched maxilla,
  while <i>Harpagus</i> and the crested <i>Baza</i>, aberrant members of the group, and sometimes
  classed with the Kites, exhibit two "teeth." <i>B. lophotes</i>, of India, Ceylon, and the Malay
  countries, is greenish-black above, varied with white and chestnut on the wings; the fore-neck
  being white, and the breast shewing a band of black above one of chestnut, which is barred with
  buff towards the black vent. <i>B. verreauxi</i>, occurring from the Zambesi to Natal, is dark
  brownish-grey, with four black bars on the white-tipped tail, and rufous bands across the white
  breast and under wing-coverts; <i>B. cuculo&iuml;des</i>, of West Africa, having the latter plain
  rufous. The somewhat similar <i>B. subcristata</i> occupies North-East Australia, <i>B. rufa</i>
  inhabits the Moluccas and Papuasia, <i>B. timorlaensis</i> Timor-laut, <i>B. erythrothorax</i>
  Celebes and the Sula Islands, <i>B. magnirostris</i> the Philippines, <i>B. borneensis</i> Borneo,
  <i>B. leucopais</i> Pal&aacute;wan, <i>B. sumatrensis</i> Sumatra, Tenasserim, and Sikkim, <i>B.
  ceylonensis</i> Ceylon and South-East India, <i>B. madagascariensis</i> Madagascar, and <i>B.
  reinwardti</i>, with grey-barred breast, the Moluccas, Timor, and Papuasia. Comparatively little
  is known of the habits of these shy forest forms, which occasionally soar, feed upon the ground on
  chamaeleons, grasshoppers and other insects, build small nests, and lay about three whitish eggs
  with brown markings. <i>Harpagus diodon</i>, of British Guiana and Brazil, is grey, with brown
  wings and tail barred with whitish, white throat with a black streak, rufous thighs and under
  wing-coverts. <i>H. bidentatus</i>, extending from Panama to Brazil and Peru, has chestnut under
  parts, <i>H. fasciatus</i> being hardly separable.</p>

  <p>Of the tiny eastern "Finch-falcons," <i>Microhierax fringillarius</i>, inhabiting the Malay
  Peninsula and Great Sunda Islands, is bluish-black, with rufous throat and abdomen, the breast,
  forehead, a stripe down each side of the neck, and partial bars on the wings and tail being white.
  It is a bold dashing species, which feeds upon insects and birds&ndash;even as large as quails,
  and lays four white eggs in holes <span class="pagenum" id="page174"><span
  class="smaller">{174}</span></span>in trees upon a bed of chips, leaves, and insect-d&eacute;bris. <i>M.
  latifrons</i>, of Borneo and the Nicobars, has a much wider frontal band; <i>M. melanoleucus</i>
  of Assam and Cachar, <i>M. erythrogenys</i> of the Philippines, and <i>M. sinensis</i> of China
  are quite white below; but the second has black thighs and the third a white nape, a character
  shared by <i>M. eutolmus</i>, ranging from India to Cambodia, wherein the throat and abdomen are
  chestnut. <i>Poliohierax semitorquatus</i>, little bigger than the foregoing, inhabits North-East
  and South Africa, the male being blue-grey with white forehead, cheeks, nape, rump, under parts
  and markings on the remiges and rectrices; <i>P. insignis</i> of Borneo and Siam is larger, with
  black shaft-stripes, but no white collar. The females have the mantle, and in the last-named the
  crown, chestnut. The African species rarely soars, but haunts low trees and bushes, occasionally
  flocking, and feeding on mice, small birds, lizards, and coleopterous insects. <i>Spiziapteryx
  circumcinctus</i>, of Chili and Argentina, is brown above and whitish below, with numerous dark
  streaks; the white eyebrows meet at the nape, and white spots and bands mark the remiges and
  lateral rectrices.</p>

  <p><i>Dissodectes ardesiacus</i>, of Arabia, North-East and West Africa, is slate-coloured with
  dark shaft-stripes, the wing-quills being brown and the tail interruptedly barred with whitish.
  <i>D. dickinsoni</i> of Benguela, the Shir&eacute; and Rovuma valleys, is brown with pale head and white
  rump; <i>D. zoniventris</i> of Madagascar has dark bands on the mantle and on the white under
  parts. <i>Hieracidea</i> (<i>Harpa</i>) <i>novae zealandiae</i>, the Quail Hawk of New Zealand and
  the Chatham Islands, is dark brown with rufous and grey barring above; the crown and nape being
  blacker, the tail shewing eight whitish bands, and the creamy-white lower surface and fulvous
  thigh-region exhibiting streaks of brown. It may be seen soaring over the plains and lower hills,
  hovering with expanded tail, or pouncing like an arrow on the rodents, birds, and lizards which
  form its food. Insects too are captured on the wing, and poultry fiercely attacked. The cry is
  screaming; the eggs resemble those of the Peregrine Falcon, and are deposited in hollows scraped
  on rocky ledges, or occasionally in rough nests among thick creepers. A smaller and bolder race
  has been termed <i>H. ferox</i> or <i>brunnea</i>, the Bush-Hawk. <i>H. berigora</i> of Australia
  and New Guinea has brown upper parts, with rufous markings that become bands on the white-tipped
  tail, creamy under parts streaked with <span class="pagenum" id="page175"><span
  class="smaller">{175}</span></span>brown, and chestnut thighs. <i>H. orientalis</i> of the same
  countries lacks the red tints, <i>H. novae guineae</i> of New Guinea is less spotted. These three
  Kestrel-like birds love swampy districts, and devour small mammals, birds, frogs, lizards, newts,
  insects, and even carrion; being valuable allies in caterpillar-plagues, but farmyard pests at
  ordinary times. The nest of sticks, lined with bark or leaves, is placed in trees, the three or
  four whitish eggs are blotched with reddish-brown.</p>

  <p>The nearly cosmopolitan genus <i>Tinnunculus</i> (Kestrel), so called from its querulous
  "bell-like" note, is separated from <i>Falco</i> rather by pattern of colour than structural
  considerations. <i>T. alaudarius</i>, the most plentiful of the British Falconidae&ndash;which is
  occasionally seen in winter near its breeding-quarters, though chiefly a summer
  immigrant&ndash;ranges from the Atlantic Islands and lat. 68&deg; N. in Europe, through Asia to Japan
  and China, reaching Fantee and Mombasa in Africa, and having been once recorded from Massachusetts
  in America. The sub-species <i>neglectus</i>, <i>japonicus</i>, and <i>saturatus</i> are darker
  than the type; wherein the male is chiefly bluish-grey above, and buff with black spots and
  streaks below; the chestnut back being spotted with black, and the white-tipped tail having a
  broad subterminal black band. The female has rufous upper parts, with dark bars continued down the
  tail. The Kestrel or Wind-hover is a shy arboreal bird of somewhat crepuscular tendencies,
  generally observed circling gracefully aloft in readiness to drop upon its prey, or "hovering"
  with rapid vibrations of the long wings, the tail expanded and the head to windward. Small mammals
  and coleoptera furnish most of the food, a few birds&ndash;very seldom game&ndash;lizards, frogs,
  worms, grasshoppers, and insect-larvae varying the diet. Its great utility is now generally
  recognised, while sensible keepers should be fast learning that all Hawks and Owls are not vermin.
  It rarely builds its own nest, but occupies deserted habitations of Crows, Pies, and other birds,
  relined sparingly with twigs and grass, or scrapes a cup in the soil of some ledge or cavity of a
  cliff. At times hollow trees, ruins, and chalk-pits are chosen, or even level ground in the
  fens&ndash;pellets of bones, feathers, fur, and beetles' elytra commonly marking the spot. The
  four to six eggs are creamy-white, blotched or thickly mottled with bright or dull red. <i>T.
  cenchris</i>, the Lesser Kestrel, with white claws, and unspotted back in the male, has four or
  five times <span class="pagenum" id="page176"><span class="smaller">{176}</span></span>wandered to
  England, and ranges from the Pyrenees, Styria, and the Orenburg district to Bokhara and North
  Africa. It sometimes occurs further north, and in winter reaches Cape Colony; the Indian and
  Chinese race, distinguished as <i>T. pekinensis</i>, having strayed to the Transvaal. <i>T.
  sparverius</i>, the "Sparrow-Hawk" of America from the Great Slave Lake to Colombia, which
  occasionally feeds on snakes, and breeds in Woodpeckers' holes, has two sub-species, <i>T.
  cinnamominus</i> of Central and South America and <i>T. caribbaearum</i> of the Antilles. <i>T.
  dominicensis</i> (<i>sparverio&iuml;des</i>) inhabits Cuba and St. Domingo, and occurs in Florida;
  <i>T. isabellinus</i> ranges from Georgia to northern South America; <i>T. alopex</i> from Nubia
  to Bogos-Land; <i>T. rupicolus</i> and the more northern <i>T. rupicolo&iuml;des</i> occupy South
  Africa; <i>T. gracilis</i> the Seychelles; <i>T. punctatus</i> Mauritius; <i>T. newtoni</i>
  Madagascar; <i>T. moluccensis</i> the Moluccas and the Sunda Islands; <i>T. cenchro&iuml;des</i>
  Australia and Tasmania. It is remarkable that no Kestrel inhabits Jamaica or Bourbon, though Cuba
  and Mauritius are respectively so near them.</p>

  <p><i>Erythropus vespertinus</i>, the Red-footed Falcon, which wanders to Britain, but breeds from
  Eastern Europe and Algeria to Krasnoiarsk, where it meets the Eastern Asiatic <i>E. amurensis</i>,
  is lead-grey in the male, with browner tail, chestnut thighs and vent region; the female being
  barred with blackish above, and having the head, nape, and under surface rufous. The cere, orbits,
  and feet are red. Both forms migrate to South Africa, keeping more to the west and east
  respectively; the latter, which crosses India and Burma, being distinguished in the male by white
  under wing-coverts, and in the female by the absence of rufous on the head, neck, and
  brown-spotted breast. In general habits like Kestrels, these birds are more gregarious, and breed
  in company.</p>

  <p><i>Hypotriorchis subbuteo</i>, the Hobby, nests sporadically in England, and extends thence to
  North Africa and Japan, occurring in the Canaries and migrating to South Africa, North India, and
  China. Both sexes are slate-coloured, having buff lower parts with black streaks, reddish vent,
  white throat and sides of the neck, and a black stripe down the latter. This bold and dashing
  little Falcon, easily recognisable by the extremely long wings, which give it a Swift-like
  appearance, is usually seen poised aloft, or rapidly pursuing the insects and birds which form its
  food. The note is shrill; the three to five eggs resemble closely freckled pinkish specimens of
  those of the Kestrel, and are <span class="pagenum" id="page177"><span
  class="smaller">{177}</span></span>deposited late in the season in disused birds' nests. The
  statement that it broods on the eggs of the Kestrel needs further proof. <i>H. eleonorae</i>, the
  largest Old World species of the genus, occupying the Mediterranean basin from Spain and the Atlas
  to the Levant, while straying to Mauritius, is uniform sooty-black; but some individuals never
  become sooty, and immature examples precisely resemble the Hobby. The habits are like those of its
  congener, but the two or three eggs are larger, and are laid in holes in cliffs, or upon the bare
  soil on stony flats of desolate islands. The very similar <i>H. concolor</i> ranges from the Red
  Sea to Madagascar; <i>H. cuvieri</i> inhabits the Ethiopian Region; <i>H. ophryophanes</i> is
  described from Colonia; <i>H. severus</i> extends from India and Ceylon to New Britain, but not to
  Australia; <i>H. lunulatus</i> from Flores to the Duke of York Island, with Australia and
  Tasmania; <i>H. fusco-caerulescens</i> and <i>H. rufigularis</i> from Mexico to Argentina, the
  former moreover reaching the southern United States and Patagonia. The powerful <i>H.
  diroleucus</i>&ndash;perhaps referable to the genus <i>Falco</i>&ndash;occurs from South Mexico to
  Peru and Brazil.</p>

  <p><i>Aesalon regulus</i>, the Merlin, called the Stone-Falcon from its habit of perching on
  rocks, is a lively and interesting little species, daring yet confiding, which preys chiefly upon
  small birds, and flies less swiftly than the Hobby, though both are used for Lark-hawking. The
  shrill note is chiefly heard at the breeding-quarters, which in Britain are generally on steep
  hill-slopes, especially where stony outcrops break the heather or grass; from four to six
  eggs&ndash;duller and less blotched than those of the Kestrel, being deposited in a hole scraped
  in the bare ground. Abroad&ndash;and exceptionally in Scotland&ndash;old nests in trees or rocky
  ledges are utilized, and the bird is perhaps occasionally its own architect. Fairly common north
  of Derbyshire its summer range extends over the moorlands from Shetland to Devonshire, and
  includes Ireland, while it visits the sea-coast in autumn. It occurs accidentally in Greenland,
  and reaches thence to the Pyrenees and the Alps, being found across Northern and Central Europe
  and Asia, and migrating to North Africa, North India, and South China. The male is slaty-blue with
  rusty nape and under surface, and is streaked with dusky throughout; the throat is white, as is
  the tip of the tail, which, besides six imperfect bars, shows a broad sub-terminal black band. The
  dark brown female has the lower parts white, the rectrices exhibiting eight light <span
  class="pagenum" id="page178"><span class="smaller">{178}</span></span>bars. In the very similar
  <i>Ae. columbarius</i>, the "Pigeon Hawk" of North America, extending to Venezuela and Ecuador,
  the tail-bars in the respective sexes are four and six. This species and the following usually
  build in trees, using twigs, roots, grass, and moss for their nests. <i>Ae.</i> (<i>Chicquera</i>)
  <i>typus</i>, the Indian "Turumti," is a larger bird, both male and female being grey above and
  white below, with red head and dark barring nearly throughout, while Ethiopian <i>Ae.</i>
  (<i>C.</i>) <i>ruficollis</i> is slightly less striped.</p>

  <p>The most typical member of the Family is <i>Falco peregrinus</i>, the almost cosmopolitan
  Peregrine Falcon, of which the sub-species <i>F. melanogenys</i> and <i>F. ernesti</i>, the
  commonest forms from the Sunda Islands to China and Fiji, are more closely barred below, though
  not so broadly as <i>F. cassini</i> of the extreme south of America. The colour is slaty-grey
  above with darker transverse markings, the head and a stripe down each side of the neck being
  blackish, and the under parts ruddy-white banded with black. Young birds are browner, and are
  streaked instead of barred. Barely separable is the smaller and darker <i>F. minor</i> of South
  Africa, the Comoro Islands, and Madagascar, with its larger race <i>F. punicus</i>, found from
  Morocco along both sides of the Mediterranean to Asia Minor. <i>F. barbarus</i>, also of the
  Mediterranean region, but chiefly confined to Africa north of the Niger, and the Soudan, is
  distinguished by its red nape, brightest in the larger sub-species, <i>F. babylonicus</i>, which
  occurs from Babylonia to North India. The Peregrine Falcon, often erroneously called Goshawk in
  Scotland&ndash;a fact accounting for many British records of the latter&ndash;is for its size the
  most powerful of the Family; and, being one of the "noble" or long-winged forms, is much used in
  Falconry, wherein the male is termed "Tiercel" and the female "Falcon," as in many other species;
  while Hunting Hawk, "Blue Hawk," and, for the young, "Red Hawk," are names common to both
  sexes.</p>

  <p>Far the most daring of our Birds of prey, the fierceness and courage are especially shewn in
  defence of its nestlings, both parents dashing angrily at an intruder, and, though rarely touching
  him, swooping down in unpleasant proximity, as he clambers along some narrow ledge or swings upon
  his rope. Should, however, the hen-bird, which sits very closely, have fresh eggs, she disappears
  on leaving them, though her consort flies wildly to and fro at some little distance, reiterating
  his shrill cry. Exceptionally <span class="pagenum" id="page179"><span
  class="smaller">{179}</span></span>savage adults may even strike the person; nevertheless, Skuas
  and certain Owls are decidedly more dangerous, whereas the ordinary Eagle is mild in comparison.
  The food consists of ducks, guillemots, pigeons, grouse, and partridges, varied by rabbits and so
  forth; yet, in spite of the undoubted damage caused to game, preservers would be wise to spare a
  due proportion of individuals in view of their utility in killing off the more weakly and diseased
  birds. The two to four eggs, usually finely blotched or thickly mottled with rich red on a creamy
  ground&ndash;though one is often paler or yellowish&ndash;are deposited in a hollow scraped on
  some bare or grassy ledge of a sea-girt or inland cliff; but occasionally nests in trees are
  utilized, or broken ground in northern regions. Two or more sites are often tenanted in turn. Long
  distances are traversed in search of food, the survivor of a pair mating again marvellously
  quickly, considering the comparatively scanty supply of partners.</p>

  <p><i>F. peregrinator</i> (<i>atriceps</i>), the Shaheen or Royal Falcon, of India, Ceylon, and
  Tenasserim, distinguishable by the deep ferruginous under surface and the general absence of
  barring, is much prized by natives for hawking, as is the docile but delicate and less courageous
  Lanner (<i>F. feldeggi</i> or <i>tanypterus</i>) by the Bedouins. The latter is buffish-brown,
  with ruddy crown and nape, a grey tinge towards the rufous-barred tail, and fawn-coloured lower
  parts with brown spots; it ranges from Loango and Unyamuesi in Africa as far as South Europe and
  Persia, and lays four eggs&ndash;lighter than those of the Peregrine&ndash;in rocks, ruins, or
  disused birds' nests, the Dashoor Pyramid being a well-known site. <i>F. biarmicus</i>, a close
  ally from South Africa, is nearly spotless below.</p>

  <p>Of the genus <i>Gennaea</i> or "Desert Falcon," <i>G. sacer</i> (<i>lanarius</i> or
  <i>milvipes</i>), the Saker, found from North Africa and East Europe to North China, has brown
  upper parts mottled with fulvous, whitish crown, nape, and lower surface streaked with brown, and
  white markings across the tail. A swift and fairly bold denizen of open country, it is used for
  bustard-, gazelle- or heron-hawking by Indians and Arabs, while it also preys on hares, birds, and
  lizards. It deposits three or four rather pointed white eggs, blotched or spotted with various
  shades of red, in a nest of sticks and grass, normally placed in a tree. <i>G. jugger</i>, the
  Luggur of India and Afghanistan, differs in being greyer above and less streaked below, with
  rufous crown and nearly uniform tail, whereas <i>G. mexicana</i> (<i>polyagrus</i>), the Prairie
  <span class="pagenum" id="page180"><span class="smaller">{180}</span></span>Falcon of Mexico and
  the western United States, has the head brown. <i>G. hypoleuca</i>, of Australia, is grey and
  black, with barred tail, and dusky shaft-streaks on the whitish lower parts; <i>G. subnigra</i> of
  the same country being almost plain blackish-brown.</p>

  <p>Much controversy has arisen concerning the noble Arctic Falcons (<i>Hierofalco</i>), especially
  those occupying Siberia and Northern America; it seems, however, most probable that three grey
  forms inhabit the latter and two the former region. In <i>H. candicans</i>, the Greenland Falcon,
  the prevailing colour is white at all ages, transversely marked above and spotted below with
  blackish; it occurs in North Greenland, Spitsbergen, Arctic Siberia and America, the Commander
  Islands, and Amur-land. <i>H. gyrfalco</i>, the Gyr- or Jer-Falcon<a id="NtA_141"
  href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> of Arctic America, Greenland, Scandinavia, Northern Russia,
  and possibly North Asia, is like a large Peregrine Falcon, but is greyer above and whiter below;
  <i>H. islandus</i>, the Iceland Falcon, of South Greenland, Iceland, North Siberia, and Arctic
  America is paler, having the whitish head streaked with dusky. <i>H. labradorus</i>, of Labrador,
  is dark throughout. All these species move southwards towards winter, the first three visiting
  Britain and the Greenland Falcon even Southern France. They are still valued in Falconry; but,
  though more powerful, they lack the spirit and dash of the Peregrine Falcon. The food consists of
  lemmings, grouse, sea-fowl, and the like; the nest of sticks, lined with softer materials, is
  placed on rocks or trees, and contains three or four whitish eggs mottled or completely covered
  with yellowish or cinnamon markings.</p>

  <p>Fam. V. <b>Pandionidae.</b>&ndash;This group is especially remarkable for the reversible outer
  toe&ndash;recalling that of the Owls, the want of an aftershaft, and the long closely-feathered
  tibiae. The strong short beak is arched and decidedly hooked; the powerful feet are roughly
  scaled; the toes nearly equal, with no connecting membranes, but with spicules beneath; the claws
  sharp, curved, and rounded; the wings long; the tail comparatively short. The other structural
  details are as in the Falconidae. The downy young are dusky, varied with rufous; the lower breast,
  the abdomen, a central stripe down the back, and several on the head, being white.</p>

  <p><i>Pandion halia&euml;tus</i>, the Osprey or Fish-Hawk, nearly cosmopolitan <span class="pagenum"
  id="page181"><span class="smaller">{181}</span></span>in range, though local everywhere, and
  absent from many of the Pacific Islands, New Zealand, Iceland, Greenland, and America south of
  Brazil, is dark brown above, with the short crest, head, nape, and lower parts white; the crown
  being streaked with blackish, and a brown band&ndash;which becomes in the male a series of
  spots&ndash;crossing the chest. The bill is dusky, the cere and feet are bluish, and the irides
  yellow. The smaller Australasian <i>P. leucocephalus</i> and the American <i>P. carolinensis</i>
  barely attain sub-specific rank. A migrant to Britain, this bird formerly bred at Ulleswater, and
  not uncommonly in Scotland, where two or three pairs still remain. Of old it often occupied rocky
  islets or ruins in Highland lochs, but the nest is usually placed in other countries on trees or
  sea-cliffs, and exceptionally on the ground; trees being the favourite site in America, in which
  country colonies are sometimes formed, consisting of even three hundred pairs. The bulky flattish
  pile of sticks and turf, lined with moss, grass, or seaweed, is invariably placed near water, and
  contains three, or rarely four, whitish eggs, beautifully blotched or overspread with dark brown,
  crimson, or claret-colour, varied with orange, buff or grey, New World specimens being usually
  duller. Surface-swimming fish form the food, and magnificent indeed is the spectacle when an
  Osprey, after poising itself vertically aloft, descends with terrific dash and splashing plunge to
  rise again with its captured prey grasped in its roughened toes. The graceful flight is varied by
  many evolutions and spiral ascents, while the loud piercing scream is chiefly heard at the
  nesting-quarters.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Of fossil Falconine forms, excluding existing species, <i>Lithornis vulturinus</i>
  is found in the London Clay (Lower Eocene); from the Upper Eocene of France comes <i>Palaeocercus
  cuvieri</i> and <i>Falco</i>&ndash;the former possibly from England also; from the Lower Miocene
  of France <i>Teracus littoralis</i>, <i>Palaeohierax gervaisi</i>, <i>Aquila</i>, <i>Buteo</i>,
  and <i>Milvus</i>; from its Middle Miocene <i>Halia&euml;tus</i> and <i>Aquila</i>. <i>Aquila</i> also
  occurs in the American Pliocene of Nebraska and Oregon; <i>Falco</i> in the Italian; from the
  drifts of Queensland we have <i>Necrastur alacer</i> and <i>Tapha&euml;tus branchialis</i>; from the
  Argentine Pampean of Lujan and the Post-Pampean of Monte Hermoso respectively <i>Asthenopterus
  minutus</i> and <i>Foetopterus ambiguus</i>; while the superficial deposits and swamps of New
  Zealand furnish a sub-fossil <i>Circus</i> and the giant <i>Harpagornis moorii</i>; and the Mare
  aux Songes of Mauritius <i>Astur alphonsi</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order VIII. TINAMIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The primitive Neotropical Order Tinamiformes, with the Sub-Order <span
  class="sc">Tinami</span>, and sole Family <b>Tinamidae</b> or <b>Crypturidae</b>, is classed here
  in accordance with Dr. Gadow's carefully-weighed decision;<a id="NtA_142"
  href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> yet the position must not be considered absolutely certain,
  most systematists placing it near the Ratitae. The complete fusion of vomer and palatine bones is
  unique among Birds, though partially noticeable in <i>Dromaeus</i> and <i>Apteryx</i>; the
  conformation of the skull, the single head of the quadrate, the separation of the ischium and
  ilium, the absence of a pygostyle, the reduced tongue, the functionless tail, the gait and bearing
  are Struthionine features; but other points of structure, the pterylosis and the habits generally,
  are Galline.</p>

  <p>The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the sternum long and slender with
  well-developed keel; the head small; the neck thin and elongated with short plumage; the beak
  fairly strong, varying in length, and composed of more than one piece, the culmen being flattened
  and usually arched; the moderate metatarsus is transversely or hexagonally scutellated, and may be
  rough or smooth behind, while the hallux&ndash;wanting in <i>Calopezus</i> and
  <i>Tinamotis</i>&ndash;is elevated, and the anterior toes are long or short, with moderate claws.
  The short wings are concave and rounded, with ten primaries and from thirteen to sixteen
  secondaries; the <span class="pagenum" id="page183"><span
  class="smaller">{183}</span></span>abbreviated tail possesses ten very weak feathers, hidden by
  the coverts in <i>Tinamus</i>, <i>Nothocercus</i>, and <i>Crypturus</i>, and hardly
  distinguishable from them in <i>Rhynchotus</i>, <i>Nothoprocta</i>, and <i>Nothura</i>, the
  coverts themselves almost forming a train in the male of <i>Taoniscus</i>. <i>Calodromas</i> has
  twelve rectrices. The tongue is small and triangular, the crop is large and globular, the
  after-shaft is rudimentary or wanting; powder-down feathers occur near the rump, and the down of
  the adults is sparing, while that of the nestlings, which run from the shell, is simple, as in
  Ratite birds, and of a buffish-brown or chestnut colour, often relieved by black markings and
  white streaks.</p>

  <p>Like Partridges in appearance, and varying from the size of a large Fowl to that of a Quail,
  Tinamous are essentially ground-birds, and rarely perch, some species being solitary and others
  forming coveys; they haunt the undergrowth of thick forests, dry bushy and grassy flats,
  or&ndash;exceptionally&ndash;rocky mountains. The flight is strong and extremely swift,
  accompanied by quick vibrations of the wings, occasionally varied by a gliding motion; so reckless
  moreover is the pace that individuals are frequently killed by striking against the first obstacle
  they meet on rising. To flush them, however, is often a vain attempt, as they run with amazing
  rapidity, and are readily concealed by the surrounding vegetation. The voice&ndash;a trill or
  mellow whistle of several notes&ndash;differs somewhat according to the species, and may be heard
  even in winter; the food consists of seeds, berries, roots, bulbs, spiders, insects and their
  larvae, maize- and potato-crops being at times seriously damaged. A hole is scraped under shelter
  of a tussock or bush, and scantily lined with dry leaves or herbage, to receive the eggs,
  deposited in some districts almost throughout the year; these are oval, and so wonderfully
  burnished as to be totally unlike those of any other bird. They vary, according to the species,
  from reddish-chocolate, wine-purple, or liver-colour to dark blue, bluish-green or primrose, and
  number from four or five to sixteen; though the smaller figures are perhaps the most reliable, as
  larger sets, though not uncommon, may be the produce of more than one hen. As in the Turnicidae,
  and to some extent in the Ratitae, the male alone incubates, sitting about three weeks, and
  feigning disablement to decoy intruders from the nest. The flesh is very delicate, and good sport
  may be had with some species near the holes where they daily dust themselves.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page184"><span class="smaller">{184}</span></span></div>

  <p>As will be seen from the following examples, the general coloration is rufous or slaty-brown,
  which may be relieved by buff, or barred with blackish above and even below; the under parts being
  often greyer, with whitish throat and belly. The sexes do not differ greatly, but the female is,
  if anything, the larger bird. Some six forms occur in Mexico, while of the remainder <i>Tinamotis
  ingoufi</i> extends the range to Southern Patagonia.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The genus <i>Tinamus</i> has ten members, <i>T. tao</i>, of South America north of
  Bolivia and Brazil, being greyish-olive, with slaty breast and buff abdomen, wavy blackish
  markings on both surfaces, black primaries, black head and neck with white spots and bands on the
  sides, and still whiter throat. Of the thirty or more species of <i>Crypturus</i>, <i>C.
  tataupa</i>, extending from Peru and Bolivia to Brazil and Argentina, is plain chestnut-brown,
  with blackish crown, grey cheeks, neck, and breast, whitish throat and belly, buffish flanks with
  black crescentic bars, red beak, and pinkish feet. It haunts dense undergrowth in forests, even
  near habitations, and frequently sits bent forward with its "tail" expanded over its back; its
  melody consists of several notes at diminishing intervals, merging into a hurried trill, which is
  terminated by a reiterated sound like choror&oacute;; its eggs are of a reddish chocolate-colour.
  <i>Rhynchotus rufescens</i> of the same countries except Peru, the "Perdiz grande" of Argentina,
  which is represented in Bolivia by the similar <i>R. maculicollis</i>, is grey-brown, with blacker
  crown, rufous cheeks, neck, and breast, and chestnut primaries; the back being barred with whitish
  and black, and the flanks with brown and white. This somewhat solitary bird threads <span
  class="pagenum" id="page185"><span class="smaller">{185}</span></span>the tall grasses of the
  Pampas like a Rail, and, if unable to escape by squatting or running, will fly for some thousand
  yards, and thrice repeat the effort before becoming exhausted, the rapid whirring of the pinions
  sounding like a vehicle driven quickly over stones. The song, as it may almost be called, consists
  of five or six flute-like notes, several individuals sometimes joining in chorus towards evening,
  when they are decidedly active. The eggs, which are dark purple, have been hatched in confinement,
  and attempts at naturalization have been made in Essex and Herts. <i>Nothoprocta</i> contains
  eight members, <i>N. pentlandi</i> of the Bolivian and Argentine Andes having the crown and back
  grey, barred with black and buff, and streaked with white, the remiges blackish and buff, the
  cheeks and breast grey, the throat, mid-abdomen and pectoral spots whitish, the flanks grey, black
  and white. Its powers of flying and running are comparatively small, and it will remain stationary
  for hours among stones or bushes in ravines, escaping observation by its dull hue. The note is a
  full-toned whistle; the food consists of seeds, fruits, and insects; the eggs are reddish-brown.
  Of seven species of <i>Nothura</i>, <i>N. maculosa</i>, the "Perdiz comun," found from South
  Brazil to Argentina, is yellowish-brown above, barred with black and streaked with whitish, the
  throat being white, the wings marked with fulvous, and the lower parts rusty with brown
  breast-spots and curved flank-bands. It is a fearless, solitary, and somewhat sluggish denizen of
  grassy plains, which does not avoid habitations, and may be knocked down with a whip or stone,
  feigning death when captured; the note resembles that of <i>Crypturus tataupa</i> without the
  final intonation; the eggs are wine-purple or liver-coloured. <i>N. darwini</i>, the shy "Perdiz
  chico" of Patagonia, is greyer. <i>Calodromas</i> (<i>Calopezus</i>) <i>elegans</i>, the
  Martineta, ranging from South Uruguay to Patagonia, has a grey and black head and neck with long
  recurved crest, elevated in excitement, two white bands on each side of the head, rufous and black
  upper parts, whitish throat and marks on the primaries, and buffish under surface with crescentic
  black bars and spots. It frequents dry bushy table-lands, often in coveys of twenty or thirty,
  which run squealing in single file before intruders, and utter, in summer only, a long plaintive
  whistle, or chorus of notes like those of <i>Rhynchotus</i>, but weaker. The flight, accompanied
  by a wailing sound, is broken by intervals of gliding; the four to sixteen eggs are deep green or
  yellowish. <span class="pagenum" id="page186"><span class="smaller">{186}</span></span>The
  remaining genera are <i>Nothocercus</i> with five, <i>Taoniscus</i> with one, and <i>Tinamotis</i>
  with two species.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order IX. GALLIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The Galliformes, or Gallinaceous Birds, constitute a large and fairly homogeneous Order,
  situated between the Tinamiformes and the Gruiformes, if we assume the former to be classified in
  accordance with the views of Dr. Gadow, and not to be placed nearer to the Ratitae; the Gruiformes
  again linking themselves to the Laro-Limicoline section of the Charadriiformes, and so forth.
  <i>Opisthocomus</i>, however, though decidedly Galline, shows considerable resemblance to the
  Cuckoo-tribe.<a id="NtA_143" href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> The present Order may be divided
  into the Sub-Orders <span class="sc">Mesitae</span>, with the Family <i>Mesitidae</i>; <span
  class="sc">Turnices</span>, with the <i>Turnicidae</i> or Button-Quails, and the
  <i>Pedionomidae</i>; <span class="sc">Galli</span>, with the <i>Megapodiidae</i> or
  Mound-builders, the <i>Cracidae</i> or Curassows, and the <i>Phasianidae</i> or Game-birds, Fowls,
  and the like; and finally <span class="sc">Opisthocomi</span>, with the Family
  <i>Opisthocomidae</i>, containing but one species, the exceptionally curious Hoatzin. Among the
  <i>Galli</i>, the <i>Megapodiidae</i> and <i>Cracidae</i> together compose Professor Huxley's
  group of Peristeropodes or Pigeon-footed forms, where all the toes are in one plane; the
  <i>Phasianidae</i> standing alone in his Alectoropodes, or Fowl-footed division, where the hallux
  is elevated above its fellows.</p>

  <p>Excluding <i>Mesites</i>, of which comparatively little is known, all the members of the Order
  agree in having a more or less globular crop, and a somewhat scanty supply of down in the adults,
  with a more uniform coating in the young, which becomes thinner in <i>Opisthocomus</i>; they may
  be distinguished from the Gruiformes, except <i>Rhinochetus</i>, by their impervious nostrils,
  while the Tinamiformes differ in the compound structure of their bills, the primitive sternum, and
  the invariably weak rectrices.</p>

  <p>Sub-Order <span class="sc">Mesitae</span>. Fam. I. <b>Mesitidae.</b>&ndash;This consists of a
  single genus, <i>Mesites</i>, from Madagascar, originally referred by Isidore Geoffroy
  Saint-Hilaire to the neighbourhood of the Pigeons, and by subsequent writers to that of the
  Passerine, Ardeine, or Ralline birds.<a id="NtA_144" href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> W. A.
  Forbes<a id="NtA_145" href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> classed it next to <i>Eurypyga</i> and
  <span class="pagenum" id="page187"><span class="smaller">{187}</span></span><i>Rhinochetus</i>;
  but Dr. Gadow, as may be seen from above, places it in the Galliformes, considering it to be a
  connecting link between that Order, the Tinamiformes, and the Gruiformes.</p>

  <p>In this curious form the bill is long and slender; the legs are rather weak, with the uniformly
  scutellated metatarsus shorter than the partially bare tibia; while the toes, which are without
  webs, are on the same level. The keel of the sternum is short, the anterior extremity hardly
  reaching beyond the middle of the breast-bone, and the clavicles are quite rudimentary. The wing
  is rounded, and has ten primaries and six secondaries; the tail is strong and well-developed, with
  fourteen (or sixteen) rectrices. Mr. E. Bartlett tells us that the quills of the soft feathers of
  the back and rump are so delicate that the plumage curls forward immediately upon the bird's
  death.<a id="NtA_146" href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> The after-shaft is absent, the pervious
  nostrils are long and linear, the lores and bluish orbits are naked. No less than five pairs of
  powder-down patches have been ascertained to exist, of which two couples are dorsal, one adjoins
  the upper pectoral muscles, and two are ventral. <i>M. variegatus</i> is cinnamon, with black and
  tawny markings, the lower parts being white with black spots and reddish flanks. The female is
  mostly rufous below. <i>M. unicolor</i> is not distinct. Hardly anything is known of the habits,
  but the nest is said to be upon the ground.</p>

  <p>Sub-Order <span class="sc">Turnices</span>.&ndash;This consists of the two Families,
  <i>Turnicidae</i> and <i>Pedionomidae</i>, each with one genus, <i>Turnix</i> or
  <i>Hemipodius</i>, and <i>Pedionomus</i> respectively; the last-named, moreover, has but one
  species. <i>Ortyxelus meiffreni</i> (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page295">295</a></span>), may
  belong here.</p>

  <p>Fam. II. <b>Turnicidae.</b>&ndash;In this group the bill is short, but commonly less stout than
  that of the <i>Phasianidae</i>, which it otherwise resembles; the metatarsus is long, slender, and
  scutellated, the hallux is absent, the claws are small, curved, and sharp. The wings are broad and
  rather short, with ten primaries and about fifteen secondaries; the abbreviated tail contains
  twelve soft rectrices, which are not so long as the upper coverts in <i>Turnix ocellata</i>, while
  in <i>T. sylvatica</i> and several nearly-allied species the median feathers are somewhat
  elongated and acute. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, and the crop is almost
  absent, but an after-shaft is present; the pointed tongue, the impervious nostrils, and the
  tracheo-bronchial syrinx calling for no special remark. Where the sexes <span class="pagenum"
  id="page188"><span class="smaller">{188}</span></span>differ, the female is almost always the
  larger and brighter-plumaged bird, the colours being black, brown, buff, chestnut, and white in
  varying admixture, and becoming less distinct with age.</p>

  <p>These small, solitary, and non-migratory forms often escape observation through their shyness,
  as they run strongly, and are flushed with the greatest difficulty, dropping quickly into cover
  after a short awkward flight; they frequent dry, grassy plains and localities covered with low
  trees or dense bushes, and utter a pleasant ringing or triple grating cry, with a mournful
  call-note at dawn and sunset.<a id="NtA_147" href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> The food consists
  of seeds and insect-larvae; the well-concealed nest is little more than a hole lined with dry
  grass, though sometimes domed with similar materials; the three to five eggs, shaped somewhat like
  peg-tops, are buff or greyish, with spots of pale grey, purplish, or dark brown. Two broods are
  raised in a season, and it is a noticeable fact that the comparatively dull-hued male performs
  all, or nearly all, the duties of incubation, sitting very closely, and feigning lameness when
  surprised with the young, which run from the shell. The adults frequently fight, but the sex of
  the combatants is uncertain.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Turnix</i> includes some twenty "Hemipodes," the Bustard- or Button-Quails of
  Anglo-Indians, which range from South Europe, Arabia, and Africa to India, China, the Liu-Kiu
  Islands, and Formosa, as well as to Australia, New Britain, and New Caledonia. The female is
  described below, unless otherwise stated. <i>T. taigoor</i>, reaching from India, Ceylon, and the
  Malay Peninsula to the Liu-Kiu Islands and Formosa, is brown above, with black bars and
  vermiculations, and buff margins to many of the feathers; the forehead and sides of the head and
  neck are white spotted with black, the mid-throat and chest are black, a whitish stripe divides
  the crown, and the under parts are buff, banded with black on the sides of the chest and on the
  breast. The whole chest is barred in the male, the centre of the throat being white. Darker birds
  apparently inhabit wetter districts.<a id="NtA_148" href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> <i>T.
  pugnax</i> of Ceylon and the Great Sunda Islands is a rufous-naped race. <i>T. fasciata</i>, with
  a rufous collar, but grey and black upper surface, inhabits the Philippines and Pal&aacute;wan; <i>T.
  rufilata</i>, of Celebes, has the throat barred with black, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page189"><span class="smaller">{189}</span></span>and a rufous vent-region, <i>T. powelli</i>
  of the Lesser Sunda Islands being similar. The males lack the rufous collar and barred throat.
  <i>T. sylvatica</i>, of South Europe and Africa generally, has in both sexes dull reddish upper
  parts, barred with black and relieved by white, grey, and buff, which cause a scaly appearance;
  the browner wings shew white spots, the centre of the crown and throat are white, the sides of the
  head, neck, and breast whitish with black spots, the mid-chest and abdomen ruddy and buff
  respectively. <i>T. dussumieri</i>, the smallest species known, occurring in India, Pegu, Hainan,
  and Formosa, differs in the wide yellowish margins of the scapulars, a feature found also in the
  blacker <i>T. nana</i> and <i>T. hottentotta</i> of Africa, wherein the sides are barred. The
  former ranges from lat. 10&deg; S. to the Great Karroo, and the latter southward of that district.
  <i>T. blanfordi</i> is found east of the Bay of Bengal to Siam and Manchuria, <i>T. tanki</i> in
  India and eastward to Tipperah, <i>T. albiventris</i> in the Andamans and Nicobars; all being
  greyish above varied with black, and having the nape rufous in the female only. <i>T. maculosa</i>
  of Celebes, Southern New Guinea, and Australia, and <i>T. saturata</i> of New Britain and the Duke
  of York group are similar, but exhibit yellow-edged scapulars; the latter possessing no rusty
  collar, but having a white throat in the male. <i>T. ocellata</i> of Luzon is a large
  greenish-brown species vermiculated with black; in which the neck and breast are bright ruddy, the
  crown is blackish banded with white, the throat and cheeks are chiefly black, and the wing-coverts
  show black ocelli with whitish margins. The male has the middle of the throat white and no rufous
  collar. <i>T. nigricollis</i> of Madagascar is grey, black, reddish, and buff above, with much
  black and white on the head; and is uniform grey below, with black mid-throat and more or less
  ruddy sides. The throat is white in the male. The female of <i>T. melanogaster</i> of East
  Australia has both throat and breast black, with white markings on the latter, the male reversing
  the colours. Other Australian forms are <i>T. varia</i>, with chestnut nuchal collar, black,
  white, and rufous upper, and grey and buff under parts; <i>T. castanonota</i>, with vinous red
  upper surface; <i>T. pyrrhothorax</i>, chiefly greyish above and rusty buff below; and <i>T.
  velox</i>, reddish-chestnut in colour with nearly white lower parts. In these four the sexes are
  alike. <i>T. leucogaster</i> inhabits Central Australia.</p>

  <p>Fam. III. <b>Pedionomidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Pedionomus torquatus</i> differs in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page190"><span class="smaller">{190}</span></span>structure from <i>Turnix</i>
  by the presence of a small hind-toe. The lax upper plumage is, in the female, reddish-brown with
  black barring and buff margins to the feathers, the lower parts being pale buff marked with black.
  A broad white collar spotted with black surrounds the neck, while a rust-coloured nape and chest
  distinguish the above sex from the male, where the collar is brown and buff. This curious bird,
  somewhat smaller than a Quail, inhabits grassy plains in Southern and Eastern Australia,
  preferring the wilder districts. The habits are much as in <i>Turnix</i>, but the nest seems never
  to be domed, the four eggs being of a light stone-colour, thickly freckled and blotched with brown
  and grey.</p>

  <p>Fam. IV. <b>Megapodiidae.</b>&ndash;The Megapodes, or Mound-builders, commence the section
  Peristeropodes (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page186">186</a></span>) of the Sub-Order <span
  class="sc">Galli</span>. The bill is short, stout, and arched, though rather slender in
  <i>Megapodius</i>; the feet are exceptionally strong, and enormous for the size of the birds,
  <i>Lipoa</i> having the smallest; while the metatarsi are usually scutellated, but are reticulated
  anteriorly in <i>Megacephalon</i>, which has comparatively short and blunt claws. The abbreviated
  wings have ten primaries and some six secondaries. The tail is long and rounded in
  <i>Talegallus</i> and <i>Lipoa</i>, with upper coverts extending to the tip in the latter; it is
  short but still rounded in <i>Megapodius</i>; long and obcordate when expanded in
  <i>Catheturus</i>, <i>Aepypodius</i>, and <i>Megacephalon</i>. The rectrices number twelve in
  <i>Megapodius</i>, sixteen in <i>Lipoa</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page191"><span
  class="smaller">{191}</span></span><i>Talegallus</i>, and <i>Aepypodius</i>, eighteen in
  <i>Megacephalon</i> and <i>Catheturus</i>. <i>Aepypodius</i> possesses an erect fleshy frontal
  crest and a pendent caruncle at the base of the fore-neck, or even a pair of lateral outgrowths
  near the nape; <i>Catheturus</i> has a vascular neck-wattle: and <i>Megacephalon</i> a rounded
  bony casque with a tubercle behind each nostril. The fleshy growths are yellow or reddish, the
  horny black. In <i>Aepypodius</i>, <i>Catheturus</i>, and <i>Megacephalon</i> the naked head is
  clothed with hair-like feathers or papillae; <i>Lipoa</i> and some species of <i>Megapodius</i>
  have a short dense crest; others have the head almost entirely feathered, others again nearly bare
  except the occipital and nuchal region, as in <i>Talegallus</i>. The naked skin may be red,
  yellow, orange, purplish, grey, or pale blue; the bill and feet are black, brown, olive, yellow,
  red, orange, horn- or parti-coloured. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">Y</span>-shaped, the
  syrinx tracheo-bronchial, the tongue sagittate, the gizzard muscular, and the aftershaft small.
  The size varies from that of a Turkey to that of a large Pigeon, the sexes being invariably
  similar.</p>

  <p>Megapodes are shy terrestrial birds found in hill-valleys, among thickets near rivers or the
  sea, or on gravelly and sandy beaches. Upon the ground their gait is not ungraceful, while they
  run well, and only take to the wing when hard pressed; if disturbed they usually seek the lowest
  branches of the neighbouring trees, hopping gradually to the higher limbs; the flight is heavy,
  but can carry them from island to island. Always difficult of observation they are rarely seen in
  company, yet the larger breeding mounds are no doubt used by more pairs than one. Hoarse croaks or
  clucks are uttered in the day-time, mewing notes or noisy cackles at night; the food consists of
  fallen fruit, seeds, berries, worms, snails, insects, and even crabs. The brownish-red,
  salmon-coloured or whitish eggs, at least as large as those of the domestic duck, are deposited
  either in mounds constructed of soil and vegetable matter, or in holes made in sandy or shingly
  ground; the decaying vegetation or the sun's heat producing the effect of an artificial incubator,
  and making parental aid needless. The young extricate themselves readily from the superincumbent
  soil, being hatched in a feathered condition, and flying almost immediately. The flesh is dark and
  usually unpalatable.</p>

  <p>Though mainly confined to the Australian Region, where it extends eastwards to Ninafou and
  Samoa, the Family reaches westward to the Nicobars, and northward to the Philippines and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page192"><span class="smaller">{192}</span></span>Ladrones, replacing the
  Pheasants within these limits&ndash;save for the Philippines&ndash;just as the Cracidae do in
  Neotropical countries. No species is yet recorded from Sumatra or Java, and confirmation is needed
  in the case of the main island of Borneo.</p>

  <p><i>Megacephalon maleo</i> of North Celebes and the Sanghir Islands is glossy blackish-brown,
  with salmon-pink breast and belly, a vaulted tail, a black casque of cellular tissue, and dusky
  bill and feet. The Maleo, as it is called, inhabits hilly country, but resorts in hundreds to
  sloping gravelly beaches to breed, holes being scratched or dug just above high-water mark, some
  four or five feet in diameter. In these from two to eight pale brownish-red eggs are laid, about
  six inches apart&ndash;at intervals, it is said, of a fortnight or so&ndash;several females
  occasionally using one cavity.</p>

  <p><i>Aepypodius bruijni</i> of Waigiou is brownish-black, with chestnut rump and breast, dusky
  bill and feet; a fleshy papillose crest adorns the head, and three wattles&ndash;one median and
  two lateral&ndash;occur on the neck, all probably red in life. <i>Ae. arfakianus</i> of New Guinea
  is black above and brownish below, with no lateral wattles.</p>

  <p><i>Catheturus lathami</i>, the "Brush Turkey" of Eastern Australia, is blackish-brown with
  greyish under surface, shewing conspicuous light margins to the feathers. It has a bright yellow
  neck-wattle, reddish head and neck, black bill and brown feet. This species forms mounds of earth
  and decayed leaves, sometimes as much as six feet high and fourteen feet in diameter at the base,
  and covers the coarse outer layers with fresh leaves and sticks. The central portion is hollowed
  out like a cup, successive layers of eggs being deposited from the circumference inwards in
  concentric circles, and the earth gradually filled in above them. Several females sometimes
  utilize the same mound, each being said to lay an egg every second day. These eggs, placed with
  the small end downwards, number from twenty to nearly forty, and are of a long pointed oval shape
  and of a white colour with minute granulations. The site is usually a level clearing among scrub,
  whither the materials are conveyed by being repeatedly thrown backwards by the feet, while the
  cock possibly assists in building.<a id="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a>
  <i>Talegallus cuvieri</i>, of Western New Guinea, Salwatti, Mysol and Gilolo, is black with
  whitish throat; the naked parts are red-brown, the bill and feet <span class="pagenum"
  id="page193"><span class="smaller">{193}</span></span>reddish-orange and yellow respectively.
  <i>T. fuscirostris</i>, of South and East New Guinea, with the Aru Islands, differs in its
  grey-black bare areas and brown bill; <i>T. jobiensis</i>, of Jobi Island and East New Guinea, has
  the bill, feet, and naked skin red. The habits resemble those of <i>Catheturus</i>: the mounds,
  which reach an internal temperature of 93&deg; F., are sometimes eleven feet high; the eggs are
  reddish with a chalky incrustation.</p>

  <p><i>Lipoa ocellata</i>, the Native Pheasant or Mallee Hen of South and West Australia, has grey
  and brown upper parts, with black, buff, and white markings, which form eyes on the wings and
  back. The breast is grey with a median black and white line, the remaining lower parts being
  whitish with a rufous tinge. The naked parts are pale blue, the bill and feet brown. This bird
  frequents both open parts of the "brushes" and dense thickets, while in manners it differs but
  little from the members of the last two genera. The mounds&ndash;usually in close
  proximity&ndash;are, however, smaller as a rule, and are stated to be used by single hens, a fact
  no doubt true in many cases. The six to eight eggs, which are pinkish-white, but become red-brown
  in a few days, are very fragile, as in other Megapodes. The natives say that an egg is <span
  class="pagenum" id="page194"><span class="smaller">{194}</span></span>deposited daily, the
  discrepancy between <i>Lipoa</i> and <i>Megacephalon</i> being in this respect very remarkable,
  but conflicting assertions are only what may be expected where several females lay together, and
  further investigation should easily decide the question.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Megapodius</i> contains some fifteen species, about the size of a small fowl, in
  which the coloration varies from olive or chestnut-brown to blackish or grey above, and from
  red-brown to pale or dark-grey below, the bill being reddish, greenish, or yellowish, and the feet
  black, red, orange, yellow, or horn-coloured. <i>M. pritchardi</i>, of Ninafou, alone has white
  bases to the primaries, and <i>M. wallacii</i>, of the Moluccas, exhibits bright chestnut bands on
  the upper surface. <i>M. duperreyi</i> (<i>tumulus</i>), which ranges from the Kangeang Islands
  and Lombok to New Guinea and North-East Australia, fashions mounds, occasionally ten feet high, in
  dense scrub, laying pale coffee-coloured eggs in long burrows bored laterally, and not in
  symmetrical circles, as does <i>Catheturus</i>. <i>M. layardi</i>, of the New Hebrides, frequents
  damp wooded ravines, and is said to deposit its red-brown eggs among leaves in hollows. <i>M.
  cumingi</i>, found from the islands north of Borneo and Pal&aacute;wan to the Philippines and Celebes,
  builds mounds of sand, leaves, and so forth, near the sea, the chalky eggs having a salmon hue.
  <i>M. eremita</i>, extending from the Solomon Islands almost to New Guinea, buries its eggs a
  couple of feet deep in open sandy spots, kept clear and fenced into allotments by the natives in
  Savo and Guadalcanar; while <i>M. nicobariensis</i>, of the Nicobars, appears to flock more than
  other Megapodes, and to lay its eggs at long intervals. <i>M. tenimberensis</i>, of the Tenimber
  Islands, <i>M. sanghirensis</i> of the Sanghir group, <i>M. bernsteini</i> of the Sula Islands,
  <i>M. forsteni</i> and <i>M. freycineti</i>, ranging from the Moluccas to Western or even Northern
  New Guinea, <i>M. macgillivrayi</i> of the Louisiade and D'Entrecasteaux Archipelagos and Eastern
  New Guinea, <i>M. geelvinkianus</i>, of the west of the latter with its islands, and <i>M.
  laperousii</i>, of the Pelew and Ladrone groups, are like their congeners in habits and
  appearance. <i>Chosornis praeteritus</i> is an extinct form from Queensland.</p>

  <p>Fam. V. <b>Cracidae.</b>&ndash;These birds are almost identical in structure with the
  <i>Megapodiidae</i>, though sharply contrasted in their arboreal habits and their style of
  breeding. They may be divided into the Sub-families (1) <i>Cracinae</i> or Curassows, (2)
  <i>Penelopinae</i> or Guans, and (3) <i>Oreophasinae</i>. Of the first of these, where the maxilla
  is higher than it is broad, the genus <i>Crax</i> has a soft <span class="pagenum"
  id="page195"><span class="smaller">{195}</span></span>cere, and nostrils in the middle of the
  bill, with the addition in many cases of frontal excrescences and wattles; <i>Nothocrax</i>,
  <i>Pauxis</i> and <i>Mitua</i> have the beak horny and the nostrils basal, <i>Pauxis</i>,
  moreover, being distinguished by a large knob on the forehead, and <i>Mitua</i> by its short,
  highly-compressed bill with swollen culmen. The remaining Sub-families have the maxilla depressed
  and broader than it is high; <i>Penelope</i>, <i>Penelopina</i> and <i>Pipile</i> exhibit bare
  throats with a median wattle, <i>Ortalis</i> a mere band of bristly-shafted feathers down the
  middle, and <i>Aburria</i> a feathered throat and vermiform wattle, while <i>Chamaepetes</i> shews
  neither wattle nor bare skin, and <i>Oreophasis</i>, the sole tenant of the <i>Oreophasinae</i>, a
  naked crown, surmounted by a cylindrical helmet. The males of <i>Crax</i>, <i>Pauxis</i>, and
  <i>Mitua</i>, and both sexes of <i>Penelope jacucaca</i>, have the trachea looped, and sometimes
  extended to the posterior end of the keel of the sternum; other forms lack the convolutions, but
  in several the state is unknown.</p>

  <p>The range covers Central and South America, excluding the Greater Antilles, Chili and
  Patagonia, but one species (<i>Ortalis vetula</i>) even reaches as far north as Texas.</p>

  <p>These handsome birds, from three feet to a foot and a half in length, frequent forests near the
  coast or wooded ravines on rivers, attaining at times an elevation of several thousand feet. They
  are often tame and show great curiosity, <i>Ortalis</i> being commonly gregarious and pugnacious;
  some forms, moreover, rarely seek the ground and are only to be seen perched among the branches,
  but others haunt the undergrowth in the mid-day heat, and <i>Nothocrax</i> is asserted to take
  refuge occasionally in hollow trees. The food consists of leaves and fruit, ordinarily procured in
  the morning or evening, while various species scratch among the d&eacute;bris like Pheasants. The flight
  is generally heavy and rapid, <i>Chamaepetes</i> in particular descending with a noisy rush and
  stiffened wings; the alarm-note is loud and harsh, and in <i>Penelope</i> cackling, but the more
  usual triple cry is clear and ringing, while <i>Ortalis</i> utters a softer call, and vociferates
  in rattling chorus. The carelessly-constructed nest of twigs, grass, moss, and leaves is of
  considerable size, and is placed on the horizontal branch of a tree, in a bush, or on a stump, the
  two to five eggs&ndash;smaller than those of a hen&ndash;being white, with a hard granulated
  shell. The young soon climb and hop about the boughs like the adults, of which the flesh is
  considered a delicacy. Several species are <span class="pagenum" id="page196"><span
  class="smaller">{196}</span></span>readily domesticated, but rarely breed in confinement. Hybrids
  with domestic fowls have been recorded. Except where mentioned below the sexes are alike.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Cracinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Crax alector</i> is black with a purplish gloss, the
  belly being white, the naked lores and orbits black, the cere and base of the bill yellow, the tip
  bluish, and the feet horn-coloured. Throughout the whole genus, which is Central and South
  American, the female has a curly crest barred with white. The remaining nine species differ in
  being greenish-black, and&ndash;except <i>C. fasciolata</i>&ndash;have a frontal knob, with or
  without a basal wattle on each side of the mandible, the colour of these parts varying from
  scarlet or yellow to pale blue or purplish-black. The tail may be tipped with white; the females
  often exhibit white barring above, and have the plumage relieved by buff and chestnut.
  <i>Nothocrax urumutum</i>, ranging from British Guiana to the Upper Amazons, is chiefly chestnut
  above vermiculated with black, and cinnamon below; the wings and tail being blackish with buff
  markings, the throat chestnut, the long crest black, the naked lores and orbits yellow and
  purplish, the bill scarlet, the feet flesh-coloured. The female has the lower parts mottled with
  dusky. <i>Mitua mitu</i> of British Guiana, Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia is blue-black, with chestnut
  <span class="pagenum" id="page197"><span class="smaller">{197}</span></span>belly, white-tipped
  tail, red bill and feet; the crest being well-developed. <i>M. tomentosa</i>, of the first two
  countries only, has a shorter crest and chestnut-tipped tail, whereas <i>M. salvini</i> of Ecuador
  has a white belly. <i>Pauxis galeata</i>, the Cashew-bird, inhabiting Venezuela, Colombia, and
  Peru, is glossy greenish-black with white abdomen and tip to the tail; the frontal knob, supposed
  to resemble a Cashew nut, being dull blue. The female shows a large admixture of chestnut and
  buff.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Penelopinae.</i>&ndash;The fifteen species of <i>Penelope</i> are brown or
  olive-green, more or less varied with chestnut and rufous, or washed with purple or bronze; the
  feathers, moreover, have often whitish margins, the head in <i>P. pileata</i>, and the outer
  primaries in <i>P. albipennis</i> becoming almost white. The wattled throat is generally feathered
  in <i>P.</i> (<i>Stegnolaema</i>) <i>montagnii</i>, but naked elsewhere, the colour being given as
  carmine in <i>P. cristata</i>, where the feet are red. The orbits are also bare, the crest is
  moderate, and the metatarsus in some cases is partly feathered. Two members of the genus inhabit
  Central America. <i>P. obscura</i>, the Pavo del Monte, alone reaches Northern Argentina, where
  <i>Crax fasciolata</i>, <i>Pipile cumanensis</i>, and <i>Ortalis canicollis</i>, the Charata, also
  represent the Family. <i>Penelopina nigra</i>, of the Guatemalan highlands, is greenish-black,
  barred and mottled with brown and buff in the female; the naked orbits are purplish, the bare
  throat, large wattle, bill and feet red. <i>Ortalis</i> contains about seventeen forms, some
  hardly worthy of specific rank, of which five occur from South to Central America and
  one&ndash;<i>O. vetula</i>, the Chiacalaca&ndash;extends to Texas. <i>O. ruficauda</i> is found in
  Tobago and the Grenadines. The coloration is brown or olive, with little or no metallic gloss, but
  relieved by chestnut, rufous and grey; the breast and belly being occasionally white or buff, the
  naked orbits and sides of the throat apparently reddish, and the feet pinkish, grey, or blue.
  <i>Pipile cumanensis</i>, of South America northwards from Bolivia and Brazil, with Trinidad, is
  greenish-black; a white crest of pointed feathers reaches the sides of the neck, some white shews
  on the wings and chest; the cere, naked orbits, lores, throat and wattle are blue, the feet red.
  <i>P. jacutinga</i> of South-East Brazil and Paraguay has a purplish gloss above, and a red
  wattle; <i>P. cujubi</i> of the Lower Amazons a brown crest margined with white. <i>Aburria
  carunculata</i> of Colombia and Ecuador is greenish-black, with a scantily-feathered throat and
  long thin wattle. <i>Chamaepetes <span class="pagenum" id="page198"><span
  class="smaller">{198}</span></span>goudoti</i>, of the same countries and Peru, is bronzy-brown
  with greyish head and rufous under parts; the Costa Rican and Veraguan <i>C. unicolor</i> being
  nearly uniform greenish-black. In both these genera the orbits are more or less naked.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Oreophasinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Oreophasis derbianus</i>, the splendid Faisan of the
  Volcan de Fuego in Guatemala, is greenish-black with dense velvety plumage extending from the
  forehead to the nostrils; the white lower parts become brownish at the sides and vent, and shew
  dark streaks; a white band crosses the tail; and a red cellular casque covered with hair-like
  feathers surmounts the head. The bill is pale yellow, the feet are vermilion.</p>

  <p>Fam. VI. <b>Phasianidae.</b>&ndash;Of really distinct Sub-families this group may be said to
  possess three, (1) the <i>Numidinae</i>, or Guinea-fowls, (2) the <i>Meleagrinae</i>, or Turkeys,
  and (3) the <i>Phasianinae</i>, or Pheasants, Partridges, and Grouse; it is, however, customary to
  class the Grouse apart as <i>Tetraoninae</i>, though a difficulty at once arises in drawing the
  line of demarcation. For example, Huxley<a id="NtA_150" href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a>
  considered <i>Caccabis</i>, <i>Francolinus</i> and <i>Coturnix</i> Galline, <i>i.e.</i>
  Phasianine; Dr. Gadow<a id="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> makes them Tetraonine;
  while Mr. Ogilvie Grant<a id="NtA_152" href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> agrees with the former,
  but does not make these genera the link between the sections. Mr. Grant's view may be conveniently
  followed, but the division is in any case arbitrary. As a matter of further convenience a
  Partridge group (<i>Perdicinae</i>) may be formed, and the "American Partridges" may stand apart
  as <i>Odontophorinae</i>.</p>

  <p>Passing mention should be made of the economical importance of this Family as a factor in our
  food-supply, whether in the wild state as game, or in the domesticated as poultry; for almost
  inconceivable numbers of birds are bred, exported, or used for eating in their native countries,
  while the value of domestic fowls' eggs can best be estimated by imagining the consequence of a
  failure in the production. Man's custom herein is no doubt guided by the ease with which most of
  the species are secured or reared, and by the great development of the pectoral muscles or "flesh
  of the breast."</p>

  <p>The body is decidedly heavy, the head usually rather small, and the neck fairly long. The bill
  is comparatively short and stout&ndash;especially in <i>Ithagenes</i>, <i>Dendrortyx</i>, and
  elsewhere&ndash;but may be more elongated, as in <i>Lophophorus</i> and <i>Euplocamus</i>; the
  maxilla <span class="pagenum" id="page199"><span class="smaller">{199}</span></span>being curved,
  and overhanging the mandible, which exhibits two serrations on each side in the Odontophorinae.
  The metatarsus is strong and relatively short in Grouse and many Partridges, but in Pheasants and
  similar forms it is much longer; the feathering descends to the toes in the Tetraoninae, except
  <i>Bonasa</i> and <i>Tetrastes</i>, the digits themselves being clothed in <i>Lagopus</i>, naked
  and pectinate at the sides in the remaining genera. No other members of the Family shew
  pectinations or have the metatarsus feathered, save <i>Lerwa</i>, where it is half covered. The
  hallux, invariably elevated, has only a rudimentary claw in <i>Rollulus</i>, <i>Melanoperdix</i>,
  and <i>Caloperdix</i>; <i>Arboricola</i>, <i>Dactylortyx</i>, and <i>Cyrtonyx</i>, on the
  contrary, have particularly long and somewhat straight claws. Spurs are of frequent occurrence on
  the feet of the males, though rare in the females, some species possessing as many as three pairs;
  they are never found in the Tetraoninae or Odontophorinae, and are represented by mere knobs in
  <i>Acryllium</i> (Numidinae). The wings are short and rounded, with ten primaries and from twelve
  to nineteen secondaries, both decreasing in length as they near the middle of the wing, which has
  thus a bilobed appearance when expanded. The primaries usually increase in length before
  decreasing, but in some cases the exterior quill is the longest, while in <i>Falcipennis</i> two
  or three of the outer feathers are sickle-shaped, and in <i>Argus</i> the secondaries are
  enormously developed. The tail is extremely variable, being long and rounded in
  <i>Lophophorus</i>; long and sharp-pointed in <i>Phasianus</i> and <i>Centrocercus</i>; moderate,
  broad, and rounded in <i>Lagopus</i>, <i>Odontophorus</i>, and so forth; similar but more
  truncated in <i>Meleagris</i>; short in most Partridges; and exceptionally abbreviated in many
  Quails. The coverts far exceed the tail in the Peacock, forming its splendid train, while they are
  much elongated in <i>Chrysolophus</i>, and to some extent in <i>Coturnix</i>,
  <i>Excalphatoria</i>, and <i>Ceriornis</i> (<i>Tragopan</i>). In <i>Pedioecetes</i> the two middle
  rectrices surpass the rest and terminate abruptly; in <i>Lyrurus</i> the exterior feathers fork
  outwards; in <i>Crossoptilon</i> and <i>Gennaeus</i> the median plumes curve over the others; and
  in <i>Lobiophasis</i> not only is this the case, but the rhachis extends beyond the webs, which
  are much reduced on the outer side of the lateral quills; in <i>Argusianus</i> and
  <i>Rheinardtius</i> the middle pair is extraordinarily lengthened. The whole tail is compressed or
  "vaulted" to a greater or less degree in <i>Gallus</i>, <i>Chrysolophus</i>, <i>Lophura</i>,
  <i>Acomus</i>, <i>Gennaeus</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page200"><span
  class="smaller">{200}</span></span>and <i>Crossoptilon</i>. <i>Excalphatoria</i> is remarkable for
  possessing only eight rectrices; ten are found in <i>Microperdix</i>, and occasionally in
  <i>Synoecus</i> and <i>Coturnix</i>; but the usual number is from twelve to twenty-four, while
  <i>Lobiophasis</i> has thirty-two in the male and twenty-eight in the female. The nostrils are
  concealed by the feathering in the Tetraoninae alone, the aftershaft is large except in
  <i>Pavo</i>, the furcula is <span class="sans fwb">Y</span>-shaped, the tongue sagittate, the
  syrinx tracheo-bronchial. The globular crop and muscular gizzard are decidedly characteristic, yet
  <i>Argusianus</i> has been said to lack the former, and <i>Centrocercus</i> the latter. In the
  male of <i>Tetrao urogallus</i> and both sexes of <i>Guttera</i> the trachea has a loop, which in
  the latter case passes through a cavity in the head of the furcula.</p>

  <p>The plumage is of the most varied description, the winter coat of <i>Lagopus</i> being commonly
  white, the males of <i>Lyrurus</i>, <i>Tetrao</i>, and <i>Melanoperdix</i> nearly black, while the
  prevailing colours in <i>Chrysolophus pictus</i> are orange and red, in <i>Gennaeus
  nycthemerus</i> black and white, in <i>Rollulus</i> dull green and maroon, in <i>Gallus</i>
  orange, red, purple, green, black, and white, in <i>Phasianus</i> metallic green, orange, and
  brown. In the <i>Numidinae</i> white or bluish spots mark the blackish ground-colour; in the
  American Grouse black, brown, yellowish-buff and white occur in varying proportions; while the
  Partridges and Quails exhibit, as a rule, still more sober tints of brown, relieved by dull red or
  buff. Peacocks, again, show a combination of beautiful metallic blues and greens with copper and
  buff, rarely found elsewhere in the Family; nor must <i>Lophophorus</i>, <i>Lophura</i>,
  <i>Lobiophasis</i>, and <i>Ceriornis</i> be left out of consideration. The ocelli or "eyes" on the
  Peacock's train hardly require mention; <i>Polyplectron</i> has similar adornments on both the
  tail and the upper parts in the male, on the tail alone in the female; <i>Argusianus</i> on the
  secondaries and rectrices in the male, <i>Meleagris ocellata</i> on the latter in both sexes. The
  feathers of the crown are curled in <i>Crossoptilon</i>, <i>Pavo</i>, and <i>Lophophorus
  sclateri</i>, and fine crests are by no means uncommon; the component plumes being more or less
  racquet-shaped in <i>Lophura</i> and <i>Lophortyx</i>, and in <i>Pavo cristatus</i> consisting of
  webs at the end of bare shafts. The crests of <i>Chrysolophus</i> and <i>Gennaeus</i> are
  recumbent, those of <i>Rollulus</i> and <i>Rheinardtius</i> upright; while, among others, the full
  head-tufts of <i>Ithagenes</i> and most species of <i>Lophophorus</i>, with the comparatively
  short ornaments of <i>Haematortyx</i>, <i>Ceriornis</i>, and <i>Callipepla</i> are worth notice.
  <i>Crossoptilon</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page201"><span
  class="smaller">{201}</span></span><i>Pucrasia</i>, and <i>Phasianus</i> have elongated
  ear-coverts or feathers behind the ear, the white plumes of the first-named being especially
  remarkable and common to both sexes; an erectile cape surmounts the nape in <i>Chrysolophus</i>;
  <i>Meleagris</i> has a peculiar patch of long bristles on the breast, <i>Bonasa</i> a ruff on the
  sides of the neck; <i>Gallus</i> and <i>Acryllium</i> have hackles or lanceolate feathers in
  various parts, moulted&ndash;in the former at least&ndash;during the summer. All these decorations
  are absent or less pronounced in the females, which are, as a rule, dull in colour.</p>

  <p>The head is entirely naked in <i>Meleagris</i>, and is covered with caruncles, an erectile
  process hanging from the forehead; a pair of long fleshy horns above the eyes distinguish
  <i>Ceriornis</i>, which has in addition a large wattle on the throat; a comb of similar substance
  is accompanied by a single median or two pairs of lateral wattles in <i>Gallus</i>; while the
  sides of the face, the orbits, or the fore-neck, are bare in many genera. The male of
  <i>Lobiophasis</i> has the head nearly naked, with no less than three pairs of wattles; though the
  female has but one rudimentary pair of the latter, and only the cheeks unfeathered. In all these
  cases the skin and outgrowths are red or blue. The head and neck are bare in the Numidinae, except
  for a crest in <i>Guttera</i>, a crescentic nuchal band of feathers in <i>Acryllium</i>, and a
  line of plumage down the crown in <i>Phasidus</i>; wattles occur at the angles of the gape in
  <i>Guttera</i> and <i>Numida</i>, both these and the naked skin being blue and red throughout the
  Sub-family, save in <i>Phasidus</i>, where the latter is yellow, and in <i>Agelastes</i>, where it
  is red and white. The bony casque of <i>Numida</i> is red or horn-coloured. The Tetraoninae have
  merely a little red or yellow skin over the eye. In females all the fleshy outgrowths are much
  smaller or absent, throughout the Family.</p>

  <p>Air-sacs of orange skin lie below the side-feathers of the neck in the males of
  <i>Centrocercus</i>, <i>Dendragapus</i>, and <i>Tympanuchus</i>, and become visible when inflated;
  they are supposed to produce the booming ventriloquistic sound, uttered in the breeding season.
  <i>Bonasa</i> has a naked space in a similar position, but its drumming is stated to be caused by
  the wings. <i>Pedioecetes</i> can hardly be said to have air-sacs, yet it also drums, while the
  exact nature of the corresponding sounds made by <i>Tetrao urogallus</i> and <i>Lyrurus tetrix</i>
  is uncertain. The "gobble" of the domestic Turkey is a parallel instance, in so far as it is
  uttered during excitement.</p>

  <p>The members of this Family, which range in size from the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page202"><span class="smaller">{202}</span></span>splendid Capercaillie (<i>T. urogallus</i>)
  to the small Quail-like <i>Excalphatoria sinensis</i>, are all weighty birds for their bulk,
  rising heavily and noisily, and travelling with low and steady, though often laboured, flight; in
  many cases the pace is extremely rapid, but comparatively short distances are covered before
  alighting. On the whole, they are certainly partial to dry localities, which may, however, be
  prairies and heaths, as in many Grouse, wooded or open country generally, as in Pheasants, or
  stony hill-sides, as in <i>Tetraogallus</i>, <i>Ammoperdix</i>, and some species of <i>Lagopus</i>
  and <i>Caccabis</i>; yet a few seem to prefer the vicinity of marshes, and others are constantly
  met with at considerable elevations. The great facility with which game-birds run, their frequent
  custom of lying until they are almost trodden upon, and that of combining into coveys or packs
  consisting of two or more broods, are too well-known to need lengthy description here. The
  strutting and parading of the cocks of the larger species is fully noticed below, while the habit
  common to most forms of dusting themselves, instead of washing, is also noticeable. Many are
  almost entirely terrestrial, a love for trees being in fact exceptional; nevertheless, instances
  might easily be adduced of roosting on branches or taking refuge there when disturbed, and though
  <i>Lagopus</i>, <i>Francolinus</i>, and <i>Perdix</i> are notoriously averse to perching, the
  writer himself has seen five or six Red Grouse sitting on low trees, within half an hour.
  <i>Tetrao</i>, <i>Lyrurus</i>, <i>Phasianus</i>, <i>Pavo</i>, and <i>Meleagris</i> well exemplify
  the polygamous habits not unfrequent in the Family, the males in such cases usually deserting
  their mates during incubation; <i>Coturnix</i> and <i>Ortyx</i>, moreover, are stated to be not
  invariably monogamous. The nest is nearly always on or close to the ground, and is formed of a few
  twigs, grass, moss, feathers, and leaves; the hole, usually scraped as a commencement, being
  sometimes barely lined. <i>Polyplectron</i>, as a rule, deposits two eggs, but the number in most
  species is much greater, from sixteen to twenty being not uncommonly found, or even more where two
  hens lay together&ndash;a fairly ordinary practice in the group. The colour in Grouse is yellowish
  or reddish, either with rufous spots or close blotches of black, purple, or orange-brown; in the
  Pheasant and Partridge it is uniform olive, and in the Odontophorinae pure white, with or without
  brown or red markings. Further information is given <span class="pagenum" id="page203"><span
  class="smaller">{203}</span></span>below. Few Galline birds, besides the American Partridges,
  breed twice in a season. The male has been observed to incubate in <i>Ortyx</i>, and in this genus
  and <i>Odontophorus</i> domed nests are on record, while many species lay their eggs in
  depressions under over-arching tufts of heather or grass. Incubation lasts from eighteen to
  twenty-eight days, the young running almost from the shell. The note is shrill in Guinea-fowls,
  Partridges, and Quails, somewhat whistling in <i>Polyplectron</i> and <i>Tetrastes</i>, and
  generally consists of two or more syllables; but in view of subsequent details, it is sufficient
  to particularize the "cok-cok-cok" of the Grouse, the crow of the Pheasant and the Cock, the cluck
  and cackle of the Hen, the scream of the Peacock, and the gobble of the Turkey. The food is
  chiefly vegetable, and includes shoots, buds, leaves, grass, bulbs, seeds, berries and other
  fruits, with a certain amount of grit; but worms, molluscs, ants and their cocoons, insects and
  their larvae, swell the list. Juniper twigs or berries are supposed to give a flavour to the Hazel
  Grouse, pine tips to the Capercaillie, whereas the "Sage-brush" of America (<i>Artemisia
  tridentata</i>) bestows its name upon the Sage-cock (<i>Centrocercus</i>), and makes its flesh
  bitter and unpleasant. The Pheasant scratches in the ground for provender, as do Turkeys and
  Fowls, while <i>Lophophorus</i>, <i>Catreus</i>, <i>Crossoptilon</i>, <i>Gennaeus</i>,
  <i>Pavo</i>, and so forth, dig for roots with the bill. American Grouse, after eating
  <i>Kalmia</i> shoots, are actually poisonous.</p>

  <p>Pugnacious habits are prevalent in the Family, and naturally attain their height in the
  courting season; but chief of all in this connection is the genus <i>Gallus</i>, which will fight
  at any time of year, being highly valued by the boatmen of Burma for the sport it provides. These
  wanderers commonly keep a cock tied by the leg in their vessels, or possess a decoy-bird to
  attract its wild relatives. Game-birds are easily naturalized or domesticated owing to their
  terrestrial habits; they hybridize readily even in a state of nature, the offspring being often
  fertile; such species, moreover, as the Pheasant, Partridge, and Red-legged Partridge will
  frequently use a nest in common. Occasionally the female assumes a plumage like that of the male;
  for example, in the Pheasant, where such individuals are called "Mules," and are stated to be
  barren. Further questions of great interest are the moult, the Grouse disease, the shedding of the
  claws in the Ptarmigan, and of the horny fringes of the toes in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page204"><span class="smaller">{204}</span></span>Tetraoninae generally, besides such points
  as the loss of the Peacock's train in summer, and the innumerable phases of plumage of the Red
  Grouse, Ptarmigan, and "Bob-white" (<i>Ortyx</i>), none of which can be usefully discussed in a
  limited space.</p>

  <p>The range of the Family is nearly cosmopolitan; but the Meleagrinae only occur in the United
  States and Central America; the Numidinae in Africa, with Madagascar and the neighbouring islands;
  and the Phasianinae in the Palaearctic and Indian Regions as far eastward as the Philippines,
  China and Japan, and&ndash;in the case of <i>Gallus</i>&ndash;Celebes. The Perdicinae are found in
  the Palaearctic, Indian and Australian Regions, though becoming decidedly scarce in Oceania; the
  Odontophorinae occupy temperate and tropical America to Bolivia and Brazil southwards; while the
  Tetraoninae are holarctic, the New World genera being more numerous than those of the Old World,
  and <i>Lagopus</i> alone being common to both hemispheres.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Numidinae.</i>&ndash;Of the curious-looking Guinea-fowls, or Pintados,
  <i>Acryllium vulturinum</i> of East Africa has a long, wedge-shaped tail, and elongated hackles on
  the mantle, chest, and lower neck; the upper neck and head being naked and blue, with a crescentic
  nuchal band of short chestnut feathers, and each metatarsus possessing four or five knobs in the
  male. The hackles are black and white, mostly fringed with blue; the remaining upper parts and the
  flanks are black spotted with white, having a purple wash on the latter; the breast and belly are
  cobalt, marked with black centrally. <i>Guttera</i> contains four black species with light blue
  spots, which show much white on the secondaries. A full and usually curly black crest adorns the
  crown; the bare head and neck, with its posterior flap of skin, is blue or purplish, and the
  throat is red, except in <i>G. pucherani</i> of East Equatorial Africa, where the hind-neck only
  is blue, and <i>G. eduardi</i> (<i>verreauxi</i>) of South Africa, with no bright colours on the
  head, neck, or throat. The latter, and <i>G. cristata</i> of northern West Africa, have
  rudimentary blue wattles at the gape, coupled with a black collar, which in <i>G. eduardi</i>
  extends to the breast and assumes a chestnut shade. <i>G. plumifera</i>, ranging from Cape Lopez
  to Loango, has larger wattles and a thin erect crest; <i>G. pucherani</i> has the outgrowths red.
  This genus and the next have no spurs. <i>Numida</i>, remarkable for the bony casque surmounting
  the naked head and neck, possesses seven or more members of clumsy build, with <span
  class="pagenum" id="page205"><span class="smaller">{205}</span></span>white spots on the black
  plumage. <i>N. meleagris</i> of West Africa and several of its islands, introduced in Ascension
  and the Greater Antilles, which is the origin of our present domestic stock, has the broad
  gape-wattles and bare tracts red, save for a blue hind-neck; the small conical helmet is
  yellowish, and a wide grey ring divides the neck from the body. <i>N. coronata</i> of eastern
  South Africa, <i>N. reichenowi</i> of East Africa, <i>N. cornuta</i> of western South Africa,
  <i>N. marungensis</i>, found from Benguela to Tanganyika, <i>N. mitrata</i> of East Africa,
  Madagascar, and the islands in the vicinity, and <i>N. ptilorhyncha</i> of North-East Africa, lack
  the collar and differ from each other in the shape of the large helmet, which may be upright or
  inclined backwards. <i>N. ptilorhyncha</i> has the naked parts blue, and a bunch of horn-coloured
  bristles at the base of the maxilla; <i>N. coronata</i>, <i>N. mitrata</i>, and <i>N.
  reichenowi</i> have a reddish casque, a scarlet top to the head, and blue cheeks and neck; the
  wattles being red in the last, but blue tipped with red in the first two, as in <i>N. cornuta</i>,
  where the helmet is vermilion. <i>N. marungensis</i> has a stouter, shorter helmet than <i>N.
  coronata</i>, which it much resembles. <i>Agelastes meleagrides</i> of West Africa is black
  vermiculated with whitish, and has a zone of white feathers at the base of the neck; the bare skin
  of the head is red, of the neck white. The male has a strong spur on each metatarsus, as has
  <i>Phasidus niger</i>, ranging from Cape Lopez to Loango, which is brownish-black with a band of
  feathers from the base of the bill to the occiput; the naked head is in this case yellow, becoming
  orange on the neck.</p>

  <p>As regards habits, <i>Numida meleagris</i> may represent the group. This wild suspicious bird
  is found in flocks of a dozen or even a hundred, not invariably of its own species, which frequent
  thick bushes, tall grass, or rocky river-sides; it runs swiftly and with perfect ease,
  occasionally travelling twenty miles a day; while, though the short wings and heavy body preclude
  extended flights, it travels with considerable power. When disturbed it usually seeks the trees,
  in which it roosts at night, and under which it shelters from the sun. The food consists of grass,
  seeds, roots, bulbs, berries, and insects, the ground being often torn up in the search; the noisy
  cry is hoarse and discordant, or sharp and metallic; the nest is a depression with little or no
  lining, placed in or under a tussock, and contains from twelve to twenty yellowish eggs with
  undecided <span class="pagenum" id="page206"><span class="smaller">{206}</span></span>rusty
  spotting. <i>Phasidus</i> is not gregarious. The rock-loving <i>Numida ptilorhyncha</i> attains an
  altitude of nine thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Meleagrinae.</i>&ndash;Of the Turkeys,<a id="NtA_153"
  href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> there are only two species, <i>Meleagris gallipavo</i> and
  <i>M. ocellata</i>. The former has three races&ndash;distinguished by the tail and its upper
  coverts being tipped with white, buff, and chestnut respectively&ndash;the united range extending
  from Southern Canada to Mexico through the Eastern and South-Western States. They are
  coppery-bronze, with purplish-green and golden sheen and black markings; the remiges being brown
  barred with white, and the tail black and brown with broad dark sub-terminal band. The reddish
  head and neck are nearly bare, shewing wrinkled warty skin and a pendent erectile process on the
  forehead; a bunch of long black bristles decorates the chest of the male, which has a stout spur
  on each metatarsus. The bill and feet are red. <i>M. ocellata</i> of Yucatan, British Honduras,
  and Guatemala, has black plumage, tipped with brassy-green, and fringed with greenish-copper, that
  becomes redder below; the rump region is steel-blue, and brilliant ocelli of green-blue margined
  with copper mark the ends of the greyish rectrices and their coverts. The frontal caruncle and the
  head are blue, with red tip and excrescences respectively, while the pectoral tuft is absent.</p>

  <p>The wild Turkey is wary and extremely quick of foot, spending the day chiefly upon the ground
  and roosting high in the trees; it frequents wooded country, and feeds upon plants, seeds, nuts
  and other fruits, with lizards and insects. In spring the males fight viciously, and show off
  before the assembled hens; strutting around with erect, outspread tails and drooping wings, while
  uttering puffing and gobbling noises. Each cock having secured a mate or two, breeding takes
  place, after which the sexes separate, but combine again in autumn and wander widely in search of
  food. A hole, scraped under some log or tuft of herbage, and lined with dry leaves, receives the
  yellowish-white eggs with red-brown spots; the number varying from ten to eighteen, or even more
  if several hens co-operate.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Phasianinae.</i>&ndash;Among these a detailed description is unnecessary of the
  fine blue, green, and rufous plumage of the Peacock (<i>Pavo cristatus</i>), or of the green,
  purple, copper, and gold ocelli <span class="pagenum" id="page207"><span
  class="smaller">{207}</span></span>on its elongated train of erectile tail-coverts; but other
  striking points are the bare-shafted crest and naked white face; while the comparatively
  dull-coloured Pea-hen lacks the train of the male and the spur on each metatarsus. In the wild
  state these birds are shy, and run particularly fast, while they occasionally fly in small flocks;
  they inhabit the hill-forests or ravines near water-courses in India and Ceylon, roosting in large
  trees, making a slight nest on the ground, ruined buildings, or more rarely branches, and laying
  from four to about ten yellowish or reddish eggs, sometimes faintly spotted with rufous. The cry
  is a harsh mewing squeal, or a "cok-cok-cok" when flushed; the food resembles that of the Turkey,
  but is at times varied by fish or flesh; and, as in that bird, the males are said to dance or
  strut around when courting, each securing three or four consorts. Peafowl are supposed to indicate
  the proximity of tigers, and are sacred to various Indian castes, while foolish superstition
  considers the eyed feathers unlucky! Introduced to England at some very early date, they were
  formerly thought a great delicacy for the table. <i>P. nigripennis</i>, the "Japanned Peacock," is
  a species, or perhaps variety, with deep blue wing-coverts and other slighter differences, the
  female being almost entirely greyish-white; <i>P. muticus</i>, a valid species from the
  Indo-Chinese countries and Java, is distinguished by the golden-green neck and chest and the blue
  and yellow skin of the face; the crest feathers being here fully webbed.</p>

  <p><i>Argusianus argus</i>, the Argus Pheasant, has a short black crest; black, rufous, and buff
  plumage with white barring on the nape and tail-coverts; and enormously developed secondaries and
  median rectrices, covered respectively with large reddish-yellow and small white ocelli, which are
  margined with black; the naked cheeks and throat are blue, the bill is bluish-white, the feet are
  red. It inhabits the forests of the Indo-Malay mainland and Sumatra, the cock being said only to
  meet the hens occasionally, and to reserve an open spot for courting purposes, where he shows
  himself off by dancing before them with the tail and secondaries expanded into a large fan. This
  bird flies little, but runs with celerity, having a loud cry, feeding on vegetable matter and
  insects, nesting like the Pea-fowl, and laying similar eggs. <i>A. grayi</i> of Borneo shows white
  on the mantle and much red on the breast, <i>A. bipunctatus</i> is only known from an imperfect
  primary. The females lack the ocelli and elongated tail. <i>A.</i> <span class="pagenum"
  id="page208"><span class="smaller">{208}</span></span>(<i>Rheinardtius</i>) <i>ocellatus</i>, of
  the Tonkin highlands, is brown with reddish markings and minute white dots; it has a hairy
  occipital crest, and exhibits fine red spots, with black white-eyed central rings, on the very
  long median rectrices and their upper coverts.</p>

  <p>In <i>Polyplectron</i> (Peacock-Pheasant) the male has two or even three spurs on the
  metatarsus. <i>P. chinquis</i> of the Indo-Chinese countries is brown, with whitish dots above and
  mottlings below; the head is black and white with naked yellowish sides; the upper plumage is
  adorned with large, round, metallic, purple-green ocelli, ringed successively with black, brown,
  and buff, of which the tail and its upper-coverts exhibit one on each web. <i>P. germaini</i> of
  Cochin China has close-set light brown specks above, and a red face; <i>P. bicalcaratum</i> of the
  Malay Peninsula and Sumatra has the latter similarly coloured, with black and buff upper surface,
  a narrow purplish crest, and lateral rectrices with an "eye" only on the outer web; <i>P.
  schleiermacheri</i> of Borneo has the crest curled forward, and blackish under parts with a white
  median band; whereas <i>P. nehrkornae</i> of Pal&aacute;wan, and the doubtfully distinct <i>P.
  napoleonis</i>, are entirely black below. As regards the duller females, <i>P. chinquis</i> and
  <i>P. germaini</i> have obscure ocelli on both webs of the lateral tail-feathers, the other
  species on the outer web only; moreover, <i>P. chinquis</i>, <i>P. schleiermacheri</i>, and <i>P.
  nehrkornae</i> have none on the tail-coverts, the latter lacking the black blotches on the mantle
  found in <i>P. bicalcaratum</i> and <i>P. schleiermacheri</i>. <i>P.</i> (<i>Chalcurus</i>)
  <i>inocellatus</i> of Sumatra is brown and buff, with purple and black tints on the tail. Little
  is known of the habits, except in <i>P. chinquis</i>, which is apparently monogamous, and
  frequents thick hill-forests up to an altitude of five thousand feet. It feeds like the Peafowl,
  has a fine whistling call varied by a soft cluck, and will take refuge in trees, though preferring
  to escape on foot. The cock carries his outspread tail on one side, while the hen uses hers to
  shelter the young. The fairly substantial nest of twigs and leaves, usually containing two
  brownish eggs, is placed on the ground.</p>

  <p>Of the four species of <i>Gallus</i>, <i>G. ferrugineus</i> (<i>bankiva</i>), the Red
  Jungle-fowl&ndash;Bhund Moorg of the natives of India&ndash;shewing much resemblance to the
  "Black-breasted Game" breed, is the origin of our domestic stock.<a id="NtA_154"
  href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> It has a vaulted tail with long drooping median feathers, a
  serrated red comb, naked red face and throat, <span class="pagenum" id="page209"><span
  class="smaller">{209}</span></span>with a wattle on each side of the latter, a spur on each
  metatarsus, and ear-lappets, which are whitish in Indian examples, but red in Burmese and Malay.
  The crown and the hackles of the mantle and rump are orange-red, the back is chiefly purplish-red,
  and the wings, tail, and under parts are glossy greenish-black, with yellowish outer margins to
  the primaries and brownish to the secondaries. Between June and September the hackles and long
  tail plumes are replaced by short black feathers. The hen has little comb, no wattles, spurs, or
  elongated rectrices; the crown is reddish and the mantle yellowish, both with black stripes; the
  wing- and tail-quills are brown and rufous; the remaining plumage being reddish-brown, deeper on
  the fore-neck and brighter on the chest, with black mottling above. This Jungle-fowl ranges from
  North-Eastern and Central India to Hainan, and from Sumatra to the Philippines, Celebes, and
  Timor; frequenting thickets and forests up to five thousand feet, but often flocking to cultivated
  country, where it feeds upon leaves, seeds, insects, and especially grain. Pugnacious towards its
  kin<a id="NtA_155" href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> it is timid with man, running with great
  speed or taking refuge in trees; the flight consists of alternate periods of flapping and sailing,
  while the cluck of the hen and the crow of the cock resemble those of domestic fowls, though the
  latter is less prolonged. The nest is a hole lined with leaves, grass, or plant-stems, containing
  from seven to twelve buff eggs; polygamy being apparently rare. <i>G. sonnerati</i>, the Grey
  Jungle-fowl of Southern, Central, and Western India, is distinguishable by the dilated shafts of
  the neck-hackles, with their wax-like yellow tips or spangles; <i>G. lafayettii</i>
  (<i>stanleyi</i>) of Ceylon by the yellow comb with red margin, and the red breast. The former
  utters a broken crow, the latter a double note, the eggs in both cases being spotted, and
  occasionally whitish in ground-colour. <i>G. varius</i> of Java, Lombok, and Flores, is greener,
  with truncated neck-feathers, an unserrated comb, and a single median wattle of red, yellow, and
  blue-green. The hens of <i>G. sonnerati</i> and <i>G. lafayettii</i> have white breast-plumage,
  barred and fringed with black, the former shewing black mottlings instead of bars on the
  secondaries; that of <i>G. varius</i> has a buff breast and a blackish back. In these three
  species crosses with domestic fowls are said to be usually sterile.</p>

  <p><i>Chrysolophus pictus</i>, the brilliant Golden Pheasant, has the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page210"><span class="smaller">{210}</span></span>crown and full recumbent hair-like crest
  golden, the fine erectile cape of truncated nape-plumes orange with blue-black bars, the mantle
  dark green and purple, the rump golden, the primaries brownish, the secondaries purplish with
  chestnut and black coverts, the larger tail-coverts and the vaulted tail with its two very long
  median rectrices black, with brown spots or stripes, the scapulars and under parts scarlet, and
  the cheeks and throat rufous. There are generally two spurs on each metatarsus, and the bare
  orbits are yellowish. The female is brown, relieved by black and buff, and has a shorter tail, no
  crest or cape. This bird, difficult to naturalize in Britain, but easily domesticated, inhabits
  wooded mountains in South and West China and East Tibet, meeting in the last two countries the
  equally beautiful Lady Amherst's Pheasant (<i>C. amherstiae</i>), which has dark green crown,
  mantle, throat, and chest, blood-red crest, white cape with blue-black bars, black and buff rump,
  glossy green and brown wings, white breast and abdomen, and black and white tail with scarlet and
  orange tips to the coverts. The orbits are blue in both sexes, the female being otherwise as in
  <i>C. pictus</i>.</p>

  <p>The original Pheasant of Britain&ndash;probably introduced by the Romans&ndash;was <i>Phasianus
  colchicus</i>, ranging from the Caspian to South-East Europe; but the Ring-necked species (<i>P.
  torquatus</i>) of Manchuria, East Mongolia, Corea, Tsu-sima, and Eastern China, imported towards
  the end of last century, has interbred with it so freely that typical examples are now
  exceptional. The latter form has a white collar and slaty lower back with dark green barring;
  while the former has the rump feathers buff, with black mottlings and purplish-red tips. The
  females, hardly separable from one another, lack the red face-wattles, the long ear-tufts, and the
  pair of spurs of the male. The above-mentioned colour of the lower back and the comparatively
  broad black basal tail-bands, are the distinguishing points of a section, which comprises <i>P.
  torquatus</i>, <i>P. elegans</i> of West China, <i>P. vlangali</i> of Tsaidam, <i>P. strauchi</i>
  of Kansu, <i>P. decollatus</i> of Western and Central China, <i>P. satscheunensis</i> of
  Sa-tscheu, <i>P. formosanus</i> of Formosa, and <i>P. versicolor</i> of Japan. Another section,
  more akin to <i>P. colchicus</i>, contains <i>P. tarimensis</i> and <i>P. zerafshanicus</i> of the
  Tarim and Zerafshan Valleys, <i>P. persicus</i> of Persia and Transcaspia, <i>P. principalis</i>
  of North-East Persia and North-West Afghanistan, <i>P. shawi</i> of East Turkestan, <i>P.
  chrysomelas</i> of the Amu-Darya, and <span class="pagenum" id="page211"><span

  All these races have the crown greenish, and differ chiefly in the colour of the scapulars,
  breast, rump, and abdomen; a white collar occurring in <i>P. torquatus</i>, <i>P. mongolicus</i>,
  <i>P. satscheunensis</i>, and <i>P. formosanus</i>, while <i>P. versicolor</i> is green below.
  Where two forms meet hybrids are not uncommon. In <i>P. soemmerringi</i> of Japan, <i>P.

  red-brown, the first species having the lower back maroon with gold reflexions, the two others a
  black and white rump, with white and chestnut belly respectively. <i>P. reevesi</i> of North and
  West China has the crown white encircled by black, the nape and throat white with a subjacent
  black collar, the remaining upper parts yellowish-red and black, with white and rufous on the
  wings, the breast black, white, and chestnut, the abdomen black, the tail is extremely long.</p>

  <p>Space is wanting to describe the various females, or to discuss the sport that Pheasants
  afford; but the swift flight, the powers of foot, the polygamous and pugnacious habits, the
  olive-coloured eggs, and the immense numbers reared artificially, must be noticed.<a id="NtA_156"
  href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> <i>P. reevesi</i>, Reeves's Pheasant, <i>P. versicolor</i>,
  the Green Pheasant, and <i>P. soemmerringi</i>, the Copper Pheasant, have also been introduced
  into Britain, the two latter and <i>P. torquatus</i> into Oregon, <i>P. colchicus</i> into the
  Eastern United States; New Zealand has received both <i>P. colchicus</i> and <i>P. torquatus</i>,
  St. Helena and Ascension <i>P. torquatus</i> only&ndash;the former island as early as 1513.</p>

  <p><i>Catreus wallichi</i> of the Himalayas has a brown head with fine white-tipped crest; a grey
  neck, yellowish and whitish upper parts, black and buff primaries, and a rufous rump, all with
  black barring; the under surface is light buff with black marks, the naked orbits are red. The
  male has a pair of spurs and very long median rectrices; the female being brown mottled with black
  and buff, having a smaller crest, a shorter tail, and at times rudimentary spurs. Considerable
  flocks frequent the grassy forest-hills up to an altitude of eight thousand feet, lying very
  closely in the day-time, though running with great speed when disturbed, and flying heavily for a
  short way; they feed towards evening on roots, seeds, berries, grubs, and insects, reiterating the
  peculiar call, whence they are named Cheer. The slight nest, generally sheltered by a bush or
  tussock at the base of a hill, contains from nine to fourteen whitish or pale drab eggs, sometimes
  sparingly spotted with red-brown.</p>

  <p><i>Pucrasia</i> contains six species or local races of "Pukras" or Koklas Pheasants, with long,
  black, erectile ear-tufts in the male, which has a spur on each metatarsus, but no naked cheeks.
  <i>P. macrolopha</i> of the Western Himalayas has a well-developed buff crest, a greenish-black
  head and neck with a white patch on each side of the latter, grey upper parts and whitish flanks
  with black shaft-stripes, brownish wings marked with buff, chestnut under parts and median
  feathers of the elongated, wedge-shaped tail, and blackish lateral rectrices with white tips. The
  black and rufous hen has a white throat, a short crest, and no ear-tufts or spurs. <i>P.
  castanea</i> of North Afghanistan and Kafiristan has the mantle chestnut, <i>P. nipalensis</i> of
  the Central Himalayas black varied by grey and reddish; <i>P. meyeri</i> of South Tibet and the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page213"><span class="smaller">{213}</span></span>Upper Mekong possesses
  a yellow nuchal collar; <i>P. darwini</i> of East China has grey bases to the outer tail-feathers;
  <i>P. xanthospila</i> exhibiting both. These monogamous birds attain a somewhat higher elevation
  than the Cheer, and utter a loud, deep crow; but otherwise the habits are the same. The five to
  nine pointed eggs are buff, speckled or blotched with red-brown.</p>

  <p><i>Gennaeus</i><a id="NtA_157" href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> has a long vaulted tail, a
  fine crest, naked sides to the face covered with red skin or wattles, and metatarsi with a single
  spur in the male. In <i>G. albicristatus</i> of the Western Himalayas the crest is white, the head
  and upper parts being black with purple and blue reflexions and white margins to the dorsal
  feathers, the primaries and abdomen brown, and the breast whitish. The female is reddish-brown,
  with delicate black markings on the grey-margined upper feathers, and shews white below and on the
  wing-coverts. <i>G. leucomelanus</i>, with blue-black crest, inhabits Nepal; <i>G. muthura</i>
  (<i>melanotus</i>), without white on the lower back, occurs in Sikkim and Bhutan; <i>G.
  horsfieldi</i>, with black breast, extending from East Bhutan to North Arakan and Upper Burma. All
  the above species have the tail black, or rarely vermiculated with white; but in <i>G.
  lineatus</i> of Burma, Siam, and Tenasserim, and the very similar <i>G. andersoni</i> of Upper
  Burma and West Yunnan, it is banded alternately with black and white, and the median rectrices are
  even whiter. <i>G. edwardsi</i> inhabits Annam. <i>G. nycthemerus</i>, the Silver Pheasant of
  South China, embroidered as a badge on mandarins' dresses, and introduced into England early in
  last century, has an extremely long white tail, obliquely marked with black on the lateral
  feathers, a purplish-black crown, crest and lower surface, white back of the neck and upper parts
  with crescentic black lines on the latter, and naked red face. <i>G. swinhoii</i> of Formosa is
  easily distinguished from its allies by the bronzy-crimson scapulars, white crest, upper back, and
  median rectrices; the remaining plumage being bluish- or purplish-black with a glossy dark green
  band upon the wing. The female is mottled with rufous, black, and buff, and has a short crest,
  while that sex of the Silver Pheasant is browner, and exhibits white on the outer tail-feathers.
  These "Kalleges"&ndash;a name strictly applicable to the first four species only&ndash;frequent
  thin forests in low valleys, and are but slightly gregarious; they perch on trees, and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page214"><span class="smaller">{214}</span></span>fly short distances when
  flushed; the note is a shrill crow, a whistling chuckle or a "chirrup;" the food is as usual in
  Pheasants. The pugnacious male is said to strut with outspread tail, and to drum with his wings
  while courting; the nest, formed of dry herbage in a depression of the soil, contains from nine to
  fourteen creamy or reddish-buff eggs.</p>

  <p>The "Eared" or Snow-Pheasants (<i>Crossoptilon</i>) have a vaulted tail with decomposed webs to
  the long decurved median feathers, fine white ear-tufts, and lax hairy plumage, shorter and curled
  on the crown. The naked papillose cheeks and the metatarsi are red, with a pair of stout spurs on
  the latter in the male. <i>C. tibetanum</i> of West China and East Tibet is white, with black
  crown, dark brown remiges, and greenish- or purplish-black rectrices. <i>C. leucurum</i> of East
  Tibet has the tail white with blue-black tip, as has <i>C. manchuricum</i> of Manchuria and North
  China, in which the mantle, nape, and breast are blackish-brown, with a faint white band between
  the ear-coverts, found also in <i>C. auritum</i> of West China and Koko-Nor, and well defined in
  <i>C. harmani</i> of Tibet. The last two have the nape, back, and under parts grey-blue. These
  elegant birds haunt lofty mountain-woods until cold weather comes on; they are comparatively tame,
  feed on leaves, shoots, roots, fruit, worms, and insects, and lay&ndash;at least in the case of
  <i>C. manchuricum</i>&ndash;from twelve to sixteen drab eggs. The plumes are worn by Tartar and
  Chinese warriors.</p>

  <p><i>Lobiophasis bulweri</i> of Borneo is a splendid bird with maroon nuchal collar and chest,
  brown remiges, white tail, and black plumage elsewhere with blue margins to most of the feathers.
  The stiff spine-pointed rectrices number twenty-eight in the hen and no less than thirty-two in
  the cock, the whole tail being compressed and the median plumes decurved; in the male the skin of
  the naked front of the head is blue, as are two caruncles present behind the ears, two smaller
  processes on the lores, and two wattles at the gape. The rufous, buff, and black female has only
  the sides of the face bare, with diminutive lateral wattles on the throat. This species skulks in
  the jungles, and prefers running to flying, having many of the habits of a fowl, though ranging up
  to two thousand feet; the eggs are stone-coloured.</p>

  <p>The magnificent Firebacks (<i>Lophura</i>) have, so far as is known, similar habits to the
  members of <i>Gennaeus</i>, though they are stronger on the wing, and utter mellower notes in
  their forest retreats; <span class="pagenum" id="page215"><span
  class="smaller">{215}</span></span>the tail is vaulted, the cheeks exhibit patches of rugose blue
  skin&ndash;red in <i>L. diardi</i>&ndash;while the male has a pair of spurs and an erect crest
  with bare-shafted plumes. <i>L. nobilis</i> of Borneo is purplish-blue with fiery chestnut
  rump-region, golden lower breast, black head, throat, and wings, the four median rectrices being
  entirely buff and the lateral black with buff markings; <i>L. vieilloti</i> of Siam, the Malay
  Peninsula, and Sumatra has the lower breast black, and the two middle rectrices white, <i>L.
  ignita</i> of China differing in its chestnut-spotted flanks; <i>L. diardi</i> (<i>praelata</i>)
  of Siam, Cambodia, and Cochin China has a grey and black mantle, neck, and breast, a golden buff
  lower back, and crimson-tipped rump-feathers. The females have the mantle red-brown or chestnut,
  and outer rectrices of the latter colour in <i>L. vieilloti</i>, but black in <i>L. nobilis</i>;
  in <i>L. diardi</i> the black wing-coverts have wide buff bars. This sex of <i>L. ignita</i> seems
  to be unknown. <i>Acomus</i> has naked cheeks, but no crest or wattles; the tail is vaulted, and a
  pair of spurs is found in both sexes. <i>A. erythrophthalmus</i> of the southern Malay Peninsula
  and Sumatra is chiefly purplish- or bluish-black with fiery golden lower back, rich buff tail, and
  white wing-markings; <i>A. pyronotus</i> of Borneo exhibits white shaft-stripes on the breast;
  <i>A. inornatus</i> of West Sumatra, of which the male only has been discovered, has black plumage
  margined with dark blue-green, therein somewhat resembling the hens of its congeners, which are
  black glossed with purplish-blue. In habits this genus apparently resembles <i>Lophura</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Lophophorus</i> contains four gorgeous species of almost unsurpassable brilliancy, among
  which the Monal, constantly misnamed the Impeyan Pheasant, is best known. The tail is rounded,
  each metatarsus is provided with a spur in the male, and bare blue skin surrounds the eye. The
  Himalayan Monal (<i>L. refulgens</i>) has a crest like that of the Peacock, uniform in colour with
  the purplish-green head; the neck is purple, coppery, and green, the mantle golden-green, the
  lower back white, and the tail chestnut; the wing- and tail-coverts being green or purple with
  blue and green reflexions, the under parts black, and the remiges dusky. Its habits differ
  somewhat from those of other Pheasants, a preference being shown for grassy hill-forests not far
  from the snow-line; it roosts in trees, though generally found on the ground during the day, and
  is not very wild, trusting to its speed of foot in open spots, but readily taking to wing in the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page216"><span class="smaller">{216}</span></span>woodlands. The flight
  is rapid and powerful, while the male is said to soar without perceptible movement of the pinions;
  the usual cry is a loud melancholy whistle. The long stout beak serves to dig up roots for food;
  but grain, fruit, grass, and insect-larvae are also eaten. The nest, or sheltered unlined
  excavation in the soil, contains from four to six oval cream-coloured eggs, closely spotted or
  blotched with reddish-brown. The cocks are reported to be non-pugnacious, and the hens
  semi-gregarious while breeding. <i>L. impeyanus</i> of South Kashmir, the true Impeyan Pheasant,
  differs in its golden-green lower back and under parts; <i>L. l'huysi</i> of Sze-chuen and
  Koko-Nor has an ordinary crest, and white spots on the blue, green, and black tail; <i>L.
  sclateri</i> of North-East Assam has a curly crown with no crest, and white-tipped rectrices; the
  two latter forms being black beneath and white on the lower back. The slightly-crested females are
  black, buff, and white; the lower back is black and buff in <i>L. refulgens</i>, whitish mottled
  with brown in <i>L. sclateri</i>, and white in <i>L. l'huysi</i>.</p>

  <p>Of Tragopan (<i>Ceriornis</i>) there are five species, remarkable for the fleshy blue horn
  above each eye and the large gular wattle in the male, who erects the former and inflates the
  latter when courting. The fore-part of the head and throat are naked or merely hairy, while the
  crested cock-bird possesses a pair of short spurs, rarely present in his mate. <i>C. satyrus</i>,
  the Horned Pheasant of the Central and Eastern Himalayas, has the crown and throat black, the
  occiput, neck, and lower parts orange-red with stiff chest-plumes, the back brown, the remiges and
  rectrices black and buff. Most of the body-feathers exhibit black-margined white spots, and the
  outer wing-coverts additional red marks; while the wattle is orange barred with blue. <i>C.
  melanocephalus</i> of the Western Himalayas has a longer crest tipped with red, none of that
  colour on the occiput, the breast black and red, and a purple wattle with flesh-coloured sides,
  blue margin and spots. <i>C. temmincki</i> of Central and South-West China has the crest and under
  parts red, the wattle blue barred marginally with red, and the characteristic spots grey without
  black rings. <i>C. blythi</i> of North-East Assam and Manipur has the wattle yellow tinged with
  blue, and a plain grey breast; whereas <i>C. caboti</i> of South-East China has the latter region
  buff. The hens are black and buff with whitish spots. These shy solitary birds occupy the higher
  hill-forests, being apparently <span class="pagenum" id="page217"><span
  class="smaller">{217}</span></span>monogamous, though found in small companies at times; they run
  slowly, take refuge in trees, and fly with a whirring sound. They roost aloft, but feed constantly
  upon the ground, eating grubs, insects, roots, flowers, fruits, and especially seeds or herbage;
  the note is a deep monotonous "bellowing" or "wailing sound." The fleshy excrescences are said to
  be chiefly developed in the breeding season, when the male, who possibly assists in incubation,
  struts before his consort like a Turkey. A nest is sometimes formed of twigs, grass, and feathers
  to contain the seven or eight whitish eggs with dull lilac spots or red freckles. Tragopans are
  mistakenly termed "Argus" by sportsmen in India.</p>

  <p>In <i>Ithagenes</i>, or Blood-Pheasant, the bill is short and stout, the tail fairly long and
  rounded, the plumage soft and acuminate; the orbits are naked and red, and each metatarsus is
  armed with two or more spurs, generally absent in the female. <i>I. cruentus</i> of the Eastern
  Himalayas and Tibet has a full buff crest, black forehead and lores, lead-coloured back and wings,
  brownish remiges and rectrices with white tips to the latter, and a green <span class="pagenum"
  id="page218"><span class="smaller">{218}</span></span>wash on the wing-coverts and rump. The
  cheeks, throat, and much of the upper and under tail-coverts are crimson, the breast is
  yellow-green with crimson streaks. <i>I. geoffroyi</i> of East Tibet and West China has a grey
  head and throat; <i>I. sinensis</i> of Mongolia and North China is similar, with rufous for green
  on the wing-coverts. Females are grey, brown, and buff. Found in flocks of twenty or thirty at
  altitudes between ten and fourteen thousand feet, these bold birds have limited powers of flight,
  great speed of foot, and a weak cackling note; they bury themselves occasionally in the snow, as
  do certain Grouse (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page238">238</a></span>), and feed on grass,
  insects, berries, and shoots of juniper or pine.</p>

  <p>If a Sub-family <i>Perdicinae</i> be admitted, it may be commenced<a id="NtA_158"
  href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> with the little known <i>Ophrysia superciliosa</i> of
  North-West India, a soft-plumaged greyish-brown species with black and white markings on the head;
  next to which comes <i>Galloperdix</i>, the Spur-Fowl, with a large bare eye-space, and two or
  three spurs on each foot in the male, reduced to a single pair in the female. <i>G. spadicea</i>
  of India, which has been introduced into Madagascar, has a brown crown, and chestnut plumage
  elsewhere, with grey margins to the feathers, and black vermiculations on the wing-coverts and
  rump; the female being mottled with black. <i>G. lunulata</i>, another Indian form, has the crown
  black with white streaks, the breast buff with black spots, and black-ringed white ocelli on the
  mantle; <i>G. bicalcarata</i> of Ceylon has both mantle and crown black with white stripes, and
  the breast whiter. These birds frequent thick jungles near the coast, or hills up to seven
  thousand feet, and are extremely wild, though hard to flush; they resort to trees in emergencies,
  and roost in them at night; the note is a harsh or plaintive whistle; the food consists of grain,
  insects, and their larvae. Four, five, or even ten whitish or buff eggs are deposited on a few dry
  leaves below some sheltering shrub. The cocks are stated to fight as viciously as Jungle-Fowl.
  <i>Bambusicola fytchii</i>, the Bamboo-Partridge, found from North-East India to China, has the
  crown and ear-coverts red-brown; the upper parts olive-brown, varied in places with black and
  buff, and longitudinally marked with chestnut, except towards the rump; the wing- and tail-quills
  reddish mottled with buff; the superciliary stripe, throat, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page219"><span class="smaller">{219}</span></span>and breast buff, the chest brown with
  chestnut and white blotches, the flanks spotted with black. <i>B. thoracica</i> of South China and
  <i>B. sonorivox</i> of Formosa have grey superciliary stripes, and the latter grey ear-coverts.
  The females only differ from the males in rarely possessing a pair of spurs. These species do not
  form coveys, but haunt long grass and bamboo-thickets on the hills, being difficult to put up, and
  uttering screaming noises; they readily challenge their neighbours to fight, roost in trees, and
  lay from seven to twelve creamy-brown eggs under shelter of a tussock or bush. <i>Ptilopachys
  fuscus</i> of the northern Ethiopian Region has brown plumage with white margins, and
  vermiculations or darker barring in many parts, the mid-breast being buff and the naked orbits
  red. The sexes are similar. Small parties or pairs frequent rocky hill-sides up to nine thousand
  feet, and are very pugnacious; they carry the tail folded, as do domestic fowls, have a sharp
  call-note and lay whitish eggs.</p>

  <p>In <i>Excalphatoria</i> the short tail of eight soft feathers is entirely hidden by the
  coverts. <i>E. sinensis</i>, the Chinese or Painted Quail, the smallest of the Phasianidae, is
  brown above with black marking and rufous streaks, a bluish shade appearing in places, and
  chestnut patches shewing on the wing-coverts; the throat and sides of the neck are black and
  white, the black forming a central patch below the chin; the remaining lower parts are slate-blue
  with a median chestnut patch on the breast. It is found from India and Ceylon to Formosa, and in
  Celebes; a darker race occupying the Philippines, many of the Malay Islands, and Australia. <i>E.
  lepida</i> of New Britain, New Ireland, and the Duke of York Islands has no chestnut on the wing,
  and little below; <i>E. adansoni</i>, of Africa south of lat. 5&deg; N., is slaty-brown above, and has
  chestnut scapulars, wing- and tail-coverts with grey shaft-stripes. The females have white throats
  and rufous breasts barred with black. The Australian form, or Least Swamp-Quail, abounds in
  marshes, the Indian frequents dry ground as well, the coveys being composed of single broods,
  which feed mainly upon seeds. The flight is very brief, the nest a mere pad of grass, on which lie
  five or six olive-drab eggs, scantily spotted with purple or red-brown. <i>Synoecus australis</i>,
  the Swamp-Quail of Australia, Tasmania, and South-East New Guinea, is reddish-brown and grey
  above, with more or less distinct black mottlings; the throat is whitish, the under <span
  class="pagenum" id="page220"><span class="smaller">{220}</span></span>surface is buff, with black
  chevrons in younger birds. The female lacks the grey tints, and is more coarsely barred with
  black. Gould describes the habits and call as resembling those of the Common Partridge, but they
  are better exemplified by those of <i>Excalphatoria</i>, while the eggs vary from ten to fourteen,
  and are creamy or greenish-white, generally closely freckled with brown. <i>S. raalteni</i> of
  Timor and Flores has a rufous throat.</p>

  <p>Of the true Quails six species may be admitted. <i>Coturnix communis</i>, the Common Quail,
  though essentially a migrant in the north, ranges throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa, and breeds
  not uncommonly in Britain, having also been introduced into the Eastern United States; while
  another African race (<i>C. capensis</i> auctt.) only differs in its reddish throat. The crown is
  dark brown with a light streak down the centre and above each eye; the upper parts are brown and
  black with buff longitudinal stripes, becoming mottlings on the remiges; the throat is white with
  a black median patch connected with the ear-coverts by two upcurved lines: the breast is
  reddish-buff, the abdomen yellowish-white, the flanks are mottled or barred with brown. The short
  tail of ten or twelve feathers lies entirely below the coverts. The hen-bird has black pectoral
  spots and a perfectly white throat. <i>C. japonica</i> of East Asia and Japan, occasionally found
  in Bhutan and Burma, has a plain brick-red throat, the sides of which and the chin exhibit
  lanceolate feathers in the female. Hybrids between this species and the Common Quail occur where
  their ranges overlap; individuals, moreover, present great variation. <i>C. coromandelica</i> of
  India and the Burmese countries, <i>C. delegorguii</i> of the Ethiopian Region, <i>C.
  pectoralis</i> of Australia and Tasmania, and the nearly extinct <i>C. novae zealandiae</i> of New
  Zealand, have the outer webs of the primaries uniform brown in both sexes; the males of the first
  two have the throat as in <i>C. communis</i>, with a black patch on the breast, and buff and
  chestnut under parts respectively; the third has the throat plain brick-coloured; and the fourth
  still brighter red. The females have no throat-mark, the hen of <i>C. delegorguii</i> being
  blackish-brown above, and that of <i>C. pectoralis</i> shewing black chest-bands, which in <i>C.
  novae zealandiae</i> cover most of the feathers. That Quails can traverse long distances is
  evidenced by the migration of large flocks in spring and autumn; but, as a rule, their flight is
  short, and they rise with great reluctance, though with considerable <span class="pagenum"
  id="page221"><span class="smaller">{221}</span></span>velocity. The trisyllabic note of the male
  is rendered "wet-my-lips" by country-folk; the food consists of seeds, slugs, and insects, sought
  among the grassy flats in general frequented. From seven to fifteen yellowish or white eggs, with
  dark brown blotches or marblings, are deposited in a hollow lined with bits of herbage, in
  standing corn or grass, the hen sitting very closely and feigning lameness to draw attention from
  the young. The male appears to be usually monogamous, while the broods or "bevies" do not form
  coveys. Two of these broods are said to be occasionally reared in a season, but how far such
  statements are due to the destruction of the first complement of eggs must remain doubtful, as in
  the case of so many other birds that breed on the ground.<a id="NtA_159"
  href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Melanoperdix nigra</i>, of the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and Sumatra, is glossy black with
  browner primaries, the female being chestnut, with black markings and a whitish chin. It inhabits
  the lowlands and lays five eggs. <i>Rollulus roulroul</i> is a most remarkable form with a frontal
  tuft of long black bristles. In the male the fore-part of the head is black, separated by a white
  band from the full hairy crest of maroon, which covers the occiput; the upper parts are dark green
  glossed with blue, the wing-coverts being maroon, and the quills brown and buff. The tail and
  under parts are black, a blue tint shewing on the breast; the base of the black bill, the feet,
  and the naked orbits are scarlet. The female has a blackish head with moderate crest, a
  grass-green body with chestnut wing-coverts edged with maroon, and a black bill. These birds
  inhabit the dense forests of the Malay Peninsula, Tenasserim, Siam, Borneo, Sumatra, and Java, up
  to an altitude of a few thousand feet; they hunt in small parties for seeds, berries, and insects,
  are very shy, quick of movement and hard to flush, and utter a mellow whistle. <i>Caloperdix
  oculea</i> of similar range to <i>Rollulus</i>&ndash;unless we separate <i>C. borneensis</i> with
  more chestnut throat&ndash;has the crown, neck, and under parts rufous-chestnut, the back and tail
  black with crescentic white anterior and reddish posterior markings, the wing-coverts brown with
  round black spots, the quills brown and buff, the face and throat buff, a white supra-aural
  stripe, and black flanks with whitish bars. The male is only distinguished by possessing a pair or
  two of spurs. This bird haunts dense uninhabited forests, and eats insects, seeds, and berries.
  <i>Haematortyx <span class="pagenum" id="page222"><span
  class="smaller">{222}</span></span>sanguiniceps</i>, of the mountain-forests of Northern Borneo,
  is brownish-black; the slightly-crested head, the throat, upper breast and under tail-coverts
  being crimson with black tips to the last-named, and the metatarsi possessing three pairs of
  spurs. The rump-feathers have partly expanded shafts. The female has the throat rufous, the upper
  breast deep chestnut, and no spurs. <i>Arboricola</i> contains nearly twenty species with almost
  naked throats, ranging from Northern India to the Indo-Chinese countries, Borneo, Sumatra, Java,
  and Formosa. The following may be taken as examples of this genus, the sexes being usually alike.
  <i>A. torqueola</i> of the Himalayas has a chestnut crown, red, black, and white nape, olive and
  black upper parts, varied with chestnut and buff on the wings, black cheeks, throat, fore-neck,
  and superciliary stripe, a white line down the sides of the throat, a white band surmounting the
  grey breast, and grey flanks with chestnut and white markings. In the female the crown is brown
  and black, the throat, cheeks, and so forth, rufous with black spots, the chest-band rusty-red.
  <i>A. ardens</i> of Hainan, of which the male only is known, is easily recognised by the peculiar
  shining orange-scarlet patch of stiff hair-like feathers on the fore-neck. <i>A. javanica</i> of
  Java has the head rufous with brownish crown, a black band surrounding the eyes and crossing the
  occiput, another encircling the base of the neck, joined to the former by a black line down the
  rust-coloured nape, and a third running from the throat to the sides of the neck. The upper parts
  are dark grey barred with black, the wings exhibiting chestnut and olive tints; the chest is grey;
  the remaining lower parts are chestnut. <i>A. chloropus</i> of Lower Burma and Cochin China has
  the crown and nape brown, the superciliary stripe, throat, and lores black and white, the
  fore-neck buff with black spots and margin, the upper parts and chest brown and black with rufous
  on the wings and rump-region, the breast red, the abdomen, sides, and black-barred flanks buff. In
  this genus the orbital and even the gular skin is crimson or purplish, the feet are commonly red,
  the bill rarely so. The various species form coveys, which frequent grassy hill-jungles and wooded
  ravines up to more than ten thousand feet; they are usually unsuspicious, and run before an
  intruder, but occasionally perch in trees, and fly rapidly when forced to rise; the single
  whistling note is loud but mellow; the food consists of leaves, roots, berries, seeds, grubs, and
  molluscs; the four white eggs, <span class="pagenum" id="page223"><span
  class="smaller">{223}</span></span>sometimes speckled with grey, are deposited with little or no
  nest, at the foot of a tree, or under a tussock among thin scrub.</p>

  <p><i>Microperdix</i> and <i>Perdicula</i>, the Bush Quails of Anglo-Indians, have a blunt
  tubercle on each foot in the male. <i>M. erythrorhyncha</i> of South and West India has the crown
  and cheeks black; a white frontal band continued down the sides of the head; brown upper parts,
  with round buff black-centred spots on the back, and black and buff markings on the wings and
  tail; a white throat bordered by black; and a grey-brown chest and rufous breast, with black spots
  on the former and the flanks. The bill and feet are red. In the female the crown is brown, the
  throat and cheeks being rufous. <i>M. blewitti</i> of Central India is only slightly different;
  but <i>M. manipurensis</i> of Manipur has a chestnut throat, becoming grey in the hen. These
  active Quail-like little birds haunt the lower mountain-thickets up to perhaps eight thousand
  feet, forming small coveys, feeding on seeds and insects, and fashioning a slight nest under some
  sort of cover, to contain from ten to fourteen pointed creamy-brown eggs. <i>Perdicula
  asiatica</i> of India and Ceylon is brown above, with wavy black dorsal barring, and black and
  buff markings on the wings and tail; the superciliary stripes and throat are chestnut with whitish
  margins; the under parts white with black bars; the feet red. The female is uniform buff below.
  <i>P. argoondah</i> of India has dull brick-red in place of the chestnut, and a whitish throat in
  the hen. It has been introduced into Mauritius. The habits are much as in <i>Microperdix</i>, but
  the nest is sometimes more elaborate, and the reddish-white or olive-coloured eggs, with possibly
  a few faint spots, number from five to seven. <i>Margaroperdix madagascariensis</i> of Madagascar,
  imported into Mauritius and R&eacute;union, has a black head with reddish-brown sides to the crown, a
  white stripe from above each eye running laterally down the neck, two others from the gape down
  the margin of the throat, rufous and black upper parts, with buff bars upon the wings and
  rump-region, and white shaft-streaks except upon the quills. The red-brown chest and black under
  surface are both margined with grey, and the latter is spotted with white; the flanks are
  chestnut, black, and white. It is called "Tro-tro," "Timpoy," or "Tsipoy" by the Malagasy, and
  inhabits grassy hills, flying rapidly for short distances, and laying from about fifteen to twenty
  eggs. Natives say that if <span class="pagenum" id="page224"><span
  class="smaller">{224}</span></span>you break these eggs you cause the death of your father, if you
  spare them that of your mother!<a id="NtA_160" href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The genus <i>Perdix</i> contains the Common Partridge (<i>P. cinerea</i>), so valuable for
  purposes of food and sport, of which it is needless to describe the plumage; yet attention may be
  drawn to the dark chestnut horse-shoe mark on the grey breast, nearly obsolete in most adult
  females, and the broad ruddy bars on the sides and flanks. The hen may be invariably distinguished
  by wide-set buff bands on the black scapulars and adjoining wing-coverts, which in the cock are
  light brown with black vermiculations and chestnut blotches. The latter sex, moreover, has grey
  instead of brown sides to the neck.<a id="NtA_161" href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> Great
  variation is noticeable in the coloration, specimens from dry soils exhibiting the richest hues,
  while some are occasionally obtained with a white horse-shoe mark, and a particularly dark variety
  has even been denominated <i>Perdix montana</i>. Hybrids are recorded with the Red-Legged
  Partridge and Red Grouse, but such are quite exceptional. Unknown in Shetland, the Partridge has
  been introduced with moderate success into the Outer Hebrides and Orkneys; but in the Highlands of
  Scotland the character of the country is often unsuitable, nor is the bird very plentiful in
  Ireland. From Scandinavia it occurs southward to the Douro valley and Naples, though rarer in
  Northern Europe, and choosing higher ground than the Red-legged species in the south; eastward it
  reaches through Asia Minor and Persia as far as the Altai Mountains. Pairing even in February, it
  does not nest until about April, the numbers of individuals reared being naturally much affected
  by subsequent excess of wet or drought. The better the cultivation the larger the stock, though
  grassy heaths, gorse-coverts, tangled hedge-rows and thickets also provide excellent harbour. Very
  rarely do Partridges desert the open for woods, or perch in trees, though during the hot hours
  they shelter in fields of turnips, clover, and so forth, emerging at other times to feed on the
  grain, seeds, leaves, and insects found among short vegetation or stubble. Cover is naturally
  eschewed when wet. They often trust to their powers of foot for escape, or crouch motionless upon
  soil that matches their plumage, while the whirring noise with which they rise is familiar to all,
  as is their heavy rapid <span class="pagenum" id="page225"><span
  class="smaller">{225}</span></span>flight at starting, and their easy gliding motion afterwards.
  The well-known crowing note is most commonly heard towards evening. The nest, a circular cavity
  lined with grass, is placed among short herbage, often near a road, the drab-coloured&ndash;or,
  exceptionally, bluish&ndash;eggs varying from nine to twenty or more in number. Both parents tend
  the young and employ many devices to mislead an intruder; at night the family parties roost upon
  the ground, and later in the year pack into larger coveys. The methods of sportsmen and poachers
  cannot be discussed at length in our limited space, but the general adoption of driving, instead
  of shooting over dogs&ndash;due to improved systems of farming&ndash;should not be left
  unnoticed.</p>

  <p><i>P. da&uuml;rica</i> (<i>barbata</i>), of Asia east of the Altai and Tian-shan Ranges, exhibits
  lanceolate feathers on the sides of the throat, like <i>Coturnix japonica</i>, and a black
  "horse-shoe" mark on the golden-buff breast; the latter part in <i>P. hodgsoniae</i>, of South
  Tibet and the extreme north of India, being white with wide bars and a large basal patch of black;
  <i>P. sifanica</i> of North-West China and North Tibet lacks the black patch, and has less black
  on the sides of the head and throat. The two last-named birds reach the snow-line at about
  eighteen thousand feet; the first of them at least having a nest and eggs like the Common
  Partridge. <i>Rhizothera longirostris</i>, of the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and Sumatra, has long
  sharp curved beak and powerful whitish metatarsi, provided with a pair of stout spurs in each sex.
  The upper plumage is rich brown with black and buff markings; a grey shade pervades the neck and
  lower back, and chestnut tints the cheeks, throat, and wings; the under parts are grey, merging
  posteriorly into buff. The hen has a chestnut fore-neck, and is less grey above. <i>R.
  dulitensis</i> of Borneo is similar.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Pternistes</i> contains the naked-throated Ethiopian Francolins. <i>P.
  nudicollis</i> of South Africa is brown above with black shaft-stripes, the mantle being greyer,
  the superciliary stripes and face black, the sides of the neck and lower parts black with white
  streaks. The female has a grey and rufous chest, the male a pair of sharp spurs. The bare orbits
  and throat are crimson, the bill and feet orange-red. <i>P. humboldti</i> of East Africa and <i>P.
  afer</i> (<i>rubricollis</i>) of western South Africa resemble the above, but have two pairs of
  spurs. <i>P. cranchi</i> differs in having the neck, mantle, and under surface <span
  class="pagenum" id="page226"><span class="smaller">{226}</span></span>mottled with black and
  white, the breast and abdomen shewing chestnut markings; in the similar <i>P. boehmi</i> the naked
  throat is yellow. These two species occur west and east of Lake Tanganyika respectively; the
  female being less black and white above and less chestnut below in the former, while the sexes are
  alike in the latter. <i>P. swainsoni</i> of South Africa is distinguishable by its rusty abdomen
  with black and chestnut blotches, the latter colour being absent in the hen; <i>P. rufipictus</i>
  of East Equatorial Africa has white neck-feathers, margined with brown and black. <i>P.
  leucoscepus</i> of North-East and the darker <i>P. infuscatus</i> of East Africa exhibit broken
  stripes of brown and white down the whole body, with yellowish-red orbits and throat; the sexes
  are alike save for the spurs in the male. In many districts the members of this genus, as well as
  the Francolins proper, closely akin to them in appearance and habits, are denominated "Pheasants."
  They haunt grassy places and brushwood, often on hills near water; the coveys feeding in the open
  on bulbs, seeds, berries, and insects, and roosting upon trees, preferably those that are
  leafless. Flying little, but running at a great pace, they utter harsh notes in the morning and
  evening, and lay six or more creamy or pinkish eggs, frequently with chalky spots, in a
  grass-lined cavity sheltered by coarse herbage.</p>

  <p><i>Francolinus</i>, inclusive of <i>Ortygornis</i>, <i>Scleroptila</i>, <i>Chaetopus</i>, and
  <i>Clamator</i> of some writers, contains forty or more species, ranging over the Ethiopian
  Region, and from Arabia, Cyprus, and Asia Minor to Persia, India, and South China. The coloration
  is rich and varied, and the sexes are commonly alike, while hybrids undoubtedly occur. Apart from
  a special study, a general idea is given by the following descriptions. <i>F. vulgaris</i>, the
  Black Partridge, ranging from Cyprus, Palestine, and Asia Minor to Assam, formerly occurred in
  Spain, Italy, Sicily, Greece, several of the Mediterranean Islands, and North Africa.<a
  id="NtA_162" href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> It has the whole plumage blackish, with buff
  markings on the crown, wings, and mantle, white ocelli on the upper back and flanks, white barring
  on the lower back and tail, a white patch below the eye, and chestnut collar and under
  tail-coverts. The bill is black, the feet are orange with a small blunt spur. The collar of the
  brownish female is confined to the nape, and the throat is white. In <i>F. levaillanti</i> of
  South Africa, the "Redwing" of English <span class="pagenum" id="page227"><span
  class="smaller">{227}</span></span>colonists, both sexes have the crown brown, edged with black
  and white, which continues down the nape and widens at its base; a black and white band outlines
  the throat and forms a patch below it, while the rest of the head is rufous. The upper parts are
  black, brown, and buff, with pale chestnut remiges; the under parts are of the last colour, varied
  with buff and black, and barred with brown on the flanks. Spurs are occasionally wanting. <i>F.
  adspersus</i> of western South Africa is very distinct, both male and female being brown above,
  with fine black and grey mottlings and black lores; the head, neck, and lower surface are white,
  with narrow black bars. The spurs are long and sharp. <i>F. albigularis</i> of West Africa is
  grey-brown, with rusty crown, white throat, buff under parts, and bright bay patches on the
  wing-coverts, the upper back and neck exhibiting white streaks edged with black. The lower back is
  blotched with black, the spurs are moderate.</p>

  <p>Of some five Asiatic species, <i>F. sinensis</i>&ndash;introduced into Madagascar, Mauritius,
  and R&eacute;union&ndash;alone reaches eastward of Assam to China; whereas <i>F. pondicerianus</i> has
  been imported into Rodriguez and the Amirante Islands.</p>

  <p>Francolins are found in family parties rather than coveys, and prefer localities near water,
  though these may consist of rushy swamps, cultivated lands, stony slopes, or maritime plains. Dry
  situations are, however, favoured, a sufficiency of cover being the chief requisite, and an
  altitude of six thousand feet being occasionally attained. Some forms roost upon the ground and
  apparently never perch, others&ndash;especially in South Africa&ndash;resort habitually to trees
  at night or when disturbed; but probably the style of country and the amount of persecution
  account for this difference, while the decrease of the commoner species in certain parts
  emphasises the fact that they are an easy prey to gunners and other foes. These birds run with
  great rapidity, and are extremely difficult to flush, still more so for a second time; when forced
  to rise they do so with a whirring noise, and fly off heavily but swiftly, to pitch again as soon
  as possible. Reposing in the shade during the hot hours, they feed in the morning and evening, at
  which times the loud, shrill cry of three bell-like notes, or the "hysterical laugh," may be heard
  in all directions. The diet consists of insects, shoots of plants, berries, seeds, and bulbs, the
  powerful bill being used for digging. The well-concealed nest resembles that of a Partridge, the
  six to fourteen eggs, found in <span class="pagenum" id="page228"><span
  class="smaller">{228}</span></span>autumn as well as spring,<a id="NtA_163"
  href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> are olive-brown or buff, occasionally with small brown spots
  or a few white shell-markings.</p>

  <p><i>Ammoperdix bonhami</i> of South-West Asia is a desert form of an isabelline colour, with
  blue-grey crown and throat, black forehead and superciliary stripes, white lores and ear-coverts,
  a few black markings near the rump, chestnut hues on the tail and flanks, and longitudinal black
  bars on the latter. <i>A. heyi</i>, ranging from Nubia to the Jordan Valley and the Persian Gulf,
  has no black on the head, the frontal band being white, and the cheeks and mid-throat chestnut.
  The rufous and buff females of the two species are indistinguishable. They inhabit wastes and
  stony ravines up to four thousand feet, in pairs or small coveys; crouching, to avoid detection,
  on the ground, which matches their colour; flying like Quails; and uttering a reiterated double
  whistle. The eight to twelve eggs, of a plain drab tint, are deposited among stones or under
  tussocks, with hardly any nest.</p>

  <p><i>Caccabis rufa</i>, the Red-legged or French Partridge, introduced into England from France,
  and inhabiting Western Europe generally from Belgium and Switzerland to the Balearic Islands,
  Corsica, Elba, and South Italy, occurs in the Atlantic Islands, but not in Africa. The crown is
  grey, a black band outlines the throat and reaches past the eyes to the forehead, the upper parts
  are reddish-grey or brownish, and the tail is partly chestnut. The abdomen is bright buff, the
  chest grey with black margins to the feathers; chestnut, white, and black stripes adorn the
  flanks; the bill, feet, and orbits are red. The male is only distinguishable by having rudimentary
  spurs. <i>C. saxatilis</i>, the Greek Partridge, has the chest plain and the flanks without white.
  It inhabits the Alps, Apennines, Carpathians, Balkans, and Sicilian hills; the eastern race, <i>C.
  chukar</i>, ranging from the Ionian Islands to Aden, Persia, Mongolia, and China, and being
  naturalized in St. Helena. <i>C. magna</i> of Tibet shews a double gorget of black and reddish.
  <i>C. petrosa</i>, the Barbary Partridge, has a chestnut crown and collar, with white spots on the
  latter; it occupies North-West Africa, Sardinia, several of the Canary Islands, and Gibraltar.
  <i>C. spatzi</i> of South Tunis differs slightly. <i>C. melanocephala</i> of South-West Arabia has
  a black crown, bluish upper parts, flanks marked with black and white, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page229"><span class="smaller">{229}</span></span>and a black mark down the fore-neck. The
  members of this genus frequent cultivated country, grassy desert-hills, and scrub-covered ground,
  up to sixteen thousand feet; they are unsuspicious in quiet parts, but such is not the case in
  England. They run and fly far and fast, but are exceptionally hard to flush, trusting almost
  entirely to their feet, and occasionally when hard pressed resorting to trees. The loud note may
  be syllabled chuk-chuk-chukar-chukar; the food consists of leaves, fruits, seeds and insects; the
  nest is a scantily-lined excavation, containing from seven to fourteen yellowish-white eggs with
  reddish specks or blotches. The pugnacious males are used by the Cypriots to attract their wild
  kindred; but in Britain they have been said&ndash;probably in error&ndash;to drive away the Common
  Partridge.</p>

  <p><i>Tetraogallus tibetanus</i>, the Tibetan "Snow-Cock" or "Snow-Pheasant," is dark grey above,
  with buff markings towards the wings and rump, and black vermiculations; the under parts are
  white, with a grey pectoral band and black streaks posteriorly. There is a yellowish naked patch
  behind the eye, the bill is orange, and the feet are red. The sexes are similarly coloured, but
  the male has a pair of strong blunt spurs. The range extends from East Turkestan to West China,
  where <i>T. henrici</i> occurs, with a grey chest. <i>T. himalayensis</i>, found from the
  Himalayas to the Hindu Kush and the Altai Mountains, has the pectoral band and a patch on each
  side of the head and nape chestnut, the chest white with black bars, the orbits yellow, the bill
  dusky, and the feet orange. <i>T. caspius</i>, extending from the Taurus to Transcaspia and South
  Persia, has the upper breast grey with black spots, and lacks the chestnut on the head; <i>T.
  caucasicus</i> of the Caucasus has the occiput and nape rufous, and the chest black and buff;
  <i>T. altaicus</i> of the Altai range has the last spotted with white, but no white bases to the
  secondaries as in the two preceding forms. These large active birds haunt stony hill-sides above
  the forest-zone and near the snow-line, being gregarious, yet keeping in pairs; they are wild and
  wary, fly straight and swiftly, utter shrill whistles or cackling notes, and feed upon insects,
  buds, roots, grass, moss, and fern. From six to nine yellowish or olive eggs with reddish or
  purplish spots, generally one-third larger than those of the Capercaillie, are laid in a hollow in
  the soil, sheltered by a stone or overhanging tuft.</p>

  <p><i>Tetraophasis obscurus</i> of East Tibet is in both sexes <span class="pagenum"
  id="page230"><span class="smaller">{230}</span></span>brownish-grey above, with blackish markings
  anteriorly, olive tints on the mantle, and buff on the wings; the throat and some blotches on the
  flanks are chestnut, the breast is grey with black spots, the abdomen grey and buff, the tail
  mainly black and white. The male has two stout spurs. <i>T. sz&eacute;chenyii</i> of Central Tibet has
  the throat fawn-coloured, and the whole of the under parts blotched with chestnut. The habits are
  apparently somewhat similar to those of the last genus. <i>Lerwa nivicola</i>, the
  "Snow-Partridge," ranging from the Himalayas to Western China, has black upper parts with white
  cross-bars, which become rufous buff on the mantle and wings; the under surface is chestnut, with
  black and white markings only shewing towards the belly. A pair of spurs distinguishes the cock
  from the hen. This species inhabits broken grassy or heathery sides of mountains in the midst of
  snow, up to an altitude of at least fourteen thousand feet; it is tamer than the Snow-Pheasant,
  flies equally well, and nestles under jutting rocks. The coveys feed on moss, seeds, and insects,
  and utter a short double Grouse-like note or a harsh whistle.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 4. <i>Odontophorinae</i>,<a id="NtA_164" href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a>&ndash;The
  "American Partridges," are Quail-like birds, rarely attaining the size of a Red Grouse, and
  readily distinguished from their kin by the doubly-toothed mandible and the lack of spurs. The
  sexes are alike, if not otherwise stated.</p>

  <p>Of some four species of <i>Dendrortyx</i>, ranging from South Mexico to Costa Rica, <i>D.
  macrurus</i>, of the former country, has a black head and throat, with a long white streak above
  and below each eye, and a rufous tip to the short, full occipital crest. The neck and back are
  chestnut and grey; the rump, wings, and tail are browner with black mottlings; the breast is
  greyish with rufous streaks. The bill, feet, and naked orbits are coral-red. <i>Callipepla
  squamata</i>, of the South-Western United States and Mexico, has a grey-brown head, with
  white-tipped crest and buff throat; the wings, rump, and tail are brownish-grey with white inner
  margins to some of the scapulars and secondaries; the mid-breast and belly are fawn-coloured. The
  remaining plumage is grey, with black margins to the feathers which cause a scaly appearance, and
  shews dusky triangular spots beneath. <i>Oreortyx pictus</i> of the Western United States
  possesses two very long black occipital plumes; olive-brown upper parts with white edges to the
  scapulars and outer secondaries; slaty head, neck, <span class="pagenum" id="page231"><span
  class="smaller">{231}</span></span>and lower surface, with chestnut throat and abdomen, of which
  the former is laterally margined with white; a white band from the chin to the lores; and chestnut
  flanks, barred with black and white. <i>Lophortyx californicus</i>, of the same countries, has the
  head and crest of two club-shaped feathers black, a yellow forehead, olive-grey upper parts, a
  black throat outlined with white, buff mid-breast, and chestnut belly, each feather of the last
  two being edged with black. A white band connects the eyes and continues behind them, while white
  streaks grace the sides and flanks. The female lacks the black and white pattern on the head, and
  has whitish lower parts with yellow-brown throat. Two other species extend the range to Mexico,
  <i>Philortyx fasciatus</i> of South Mexico has an olive-brown upper surface, washed with rufous on
  the crown and the greyer neck and mantle, and barred or blotched with black and buff on the lower
  back, wings, and tail; the blackish crest is tipped with red; the throat and lower parts are
  white, with a few median spots and pronounced black bars on the chest, sides, and flanks, where
  the feathers have rusty margins. <i>Eupsychortyx cristatus</i> of Cura&ccedil;ao and Aruba has half a
  dozen congeners, ranging through Central and northern South America. It has a buff crest, crown,
  and throat; black and white nape and cheeks; reddish-grey upper parts mottled and blotched with
  black and buff; and rufous lower surface, barred with black, and spotted on the chest, sides, and
  flanks with white. In the female the black on the head is replaced by buff. <i>Ortyx
  virginianus</i> of the Eastern United States is rufous and grey above with black blotches, the
  crown is blackish, the sides of the head are transversely striped with black and white, the white
  throat is margined with black, the lower parts are reddish-white with black chevrons. The hen-bird
  has a buff throat, and shews little black on the cheeks. This genus contains eight members, often
  called Colins, which range as far south as Mexico and Cuba. The three species of <i>Cyrtonyx</i>
  extend from the Southern United States to Guatemala; they all have full crests, highly-developed
  wing-coverts, and very short, soft tails. The sides of the head and neck exhibit a peculiar black
  and white pattern, while those of the body are grey, ocellated with white or varied with chestnut.
  The females lack the pattern on the head. As an example, <i>C. montezumae</i> is rufous above,
  barred with black, and streaked with buff and white; the breast being chiefly <span
  class="pagenum" id="page232"><span class="smaller">{232}</span></span>chestnut and the abdomen
  black. <i>Dactylortyx thoracicus</i> of Central America has brown upper parts, with black blotches
  and rufous and buff mottlings; the superciliary stripes, cheeks, and throat are chestnut, with a
  black patch on each side of the last; the under surface is reddish-grey with white shaft-stripes.
  In the hen the chestnut is replaced by whitish. The crest is not so full as in
  <i>Odontophorus</i>, of which some fourteen species extend from South Mexico to Bolivia and South
  Brazil. <i>O. guianensis</i>, ranging from Panama to Bolivia and Amazonia, has the head and throat
  mainly chestnut, the neck and mantle grey, the lower back reddish-brown&ndash;all except the grey
  portions being marked with buff and black; the mid-throat is grey, the under parts orange-brown,
  with dusky barring on the chest and sides. The naked orbits are reddish; the bill is black, the
  feet are rather lighter, as in the Sub-family generally. <i>Rhynchortyx spodiostethus</i> of
  Veragua and Panama has the crown brown, the rest of the head chiefly rusty-red, the mantle grey
  and brown, the lower back buff relieved by grey and black, the wings more chestnut, the lower
  parts dark grey, with white and buff centres to the throat and breast respectively, and
  black-barred flanks. <i>R. cinctus</i> of Veragua has a rufous chest and olive-brown cheeks.</p>

  <p>As an instance of the habits we may take <i>Ortyx virginianus</i>, called Bob-white from the
  shrill triple whistle of the male, which resembles "Ah-bob-white." It is a wary denizen of open
  woods and pastures, found in coveys, and roosting on the ground, though habitually taking refuge
  in trees, where it crouches upon the branches. It runs very swiftly, but rises, when hard pressed,
  with a whirring noise to fly for a short distance. The food consists of succulent shoots, seeds,
  berries, acorns, beech-nuts, and insects; the nest is imbedded in grass or placed at the foot of a
  tree, and is made of a little herbage, which may even arch over it; the white or drab eggs number
  from nine to eighteen. The male is said to assist in incubation, two broods being occasionally
  reared in a season. The female utters a clucking sound, and will feign lameness when with her
  brood.</p>

  <p>Other forms prefer pine-forests, rocky ground, or dry sandy flats overgrown with cactus and
  sage-brush; their cries being in some cases louder or more guttural, while the eggs may be
  blotched or spotted with reddish-brown. Nests have even been recorded low down in trees. <i>Ortyx
  virginianus</i> has been <span class="pagenum" id="page233"><span
  class="smaller">{233}</span></span>introduced into the West Indies and the Old World, though
  unsuccessfully in the latter; <i>Lophortyx californicus</i> into Europe, the Sandwich Islands, and
  New Zealand, in the last two of which it is firmly established. In America, moreover, some species
  seem to have lately extended their range. Hybrids are occasionally found.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 5. <i>Tetraoninae.</i>&ndash;<i>Bonasa umbellus</i>, the Ruffed Grouse, which inhabits
  the greater part of North America, is remarkable for the frills of black or chestnut feathers
  surmounting a bare space on the sides of the neck, and for the partially naked metatarsi. Both
  sexes are rufous or greyish above, with buff and black markings, a short blackish crest, and a
  black subterminal tail-bar; the under parts being buff, relieved by brown and white. Great
  variation, however, is shown, and sub-species may be easily differentiated. When undisturbed, the
  "Pheasant" or "Partridge," as it is variously called by local sportsmen, is tame, and prefers
  undulating wooded country in the neighbourhood of cultivation, though it is also found in
  proximity to the hills. The habits resemble those of the following species, but the food is
  somewhat more varied, and includes beech-nuts, chestnuts, and acorns. In spring the cock often
  struts upon some log, and drums after the manner of other American grouse; but the habit is not
  confined to that season, nor is the sound produced by inflated neck-sacs, but by the wings. The
  absence of the hens, moreover, suggests that the performance is not amatory. From eight to
  fourteen or more eggs are laid, of a whitish or buff colour, with or without round reddish spots.
  <i>B. sylvestris</i>, the Hazel Grouse&ndash;the Gelinotte of the French&ndash;is a smaller and
  darker bird, with white markings on the wings, and a black throat surrounded by a white line,
  which reaches to the forehead. There is no ruff, and the female differs from the male in her
  whitish throat. It inhabits hill-forests in Europe and Asia up to three thousand feet, extending
  southward to Northern Spain, North Italy, Transylvania, China, and Japan, but not occurring in
  Britain. The food consists of shoots and buds of birch and hazel, seeds, berries, and other fruit,
  worms, insects, and their larvae. The flight is noisy, but not protracted, the birds resorting to
  trees and squatting on the branches. The usual note is a melancholy whistle, followed by a
  chirping sound. The slight nest contains from six to fifteen yellowish eggs, spotted with a little
  rufous, which are deposited early in spring, as is commonly the case in the Family. <i>B. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page234"><span class="smaller">{234}</span></span>griseiventris</i> and <i>B.
  severtzovi</i> are the representative forms in the Government of Perm in Russia, and the districts
  from Koko-Nor to South Mongolia respectively. The Old World species, sometimes denominated
  <i>Tetrastes</i>, are monogamous, and do not "drum."</p>

  <p>Different races of <i>Pedioecetes phasianellus</i>, the well-known Prairie Chicken, occupy
  America as far southwards as North California, New Mexico, Wisconsin, and Illinois. Both male and
  female shew black, red-brown, and yellowish tints above, with white streaks on the scapulars and
  spots on the wings, the lower surface being white with dusky markings. The short tail, with two
  elongated, but truncated median rectrices, gives it the name of Sharp-tailed Grouse. This shy
  denizen of the woods and prairies extends almost to the Arctic barren grounds in spring, that
  season being remarkable for the conduct of both sexes, which meet to hold regular dances on
  elevated spots, aptly compared to the hills of Ruffs. No doubt the cocks are the chief performers,
  but they are said to be monogamous, though their actions resemble those of their polygamous
  allies. The flight is strong and rapid, with alternate periods of flapping and sailing; the note
  is a triple whistle or a "cack-cack-cack." The food includes shoots of plants, grass, berries, and
  insects, the last-named being the chief diet of the young, as in the case of many other American
  Grouse. About fourteen eggs are deposited in a cavity scraped amidst rank herbage, and but
  slightly lined; their colour is brownish with darker spots, or occasionally creamy with marks of
  red.</p>

  <p><i>Centrocercus urophasianus</i>, the Sage-Cock of the Western United States and the adjoining
  portions of British America, has the upper parts mottled with black, grey-brown, rufous, and buff,
  the lower parts black, relieved by a white chest. The tail is long and wedge-shaped, with
  attenuated feathers; the sides of the neck and lower throat possess stiff spiny plumage, and the
  former bare orange air-sacs, as in the species next to be mentioned. The female lacks the black
  spots on the white throat. This bird, the largest of the New World Tetraoninae, is generally
  unsuspicious, and runs ahead of the traveller uttering cackling or clucking notes; when hard
  pressed it rises with fluttering action, and flies off rapidly to a considerable distance. The
  food consists chiefly of "sage-brush" (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i>), but other leaves and flowers,
  seeds, berries, grain, and insects vary the fare. The habits at the mating-time resemble those of
  <i>Dendragapus</i> and <span class="pagenum" id="page235"><span
  class="smaller">{235}</span></span><i>Tympanuchus</i>, while the eggs, from seven to seventeen in
  number, may be found placed in an excavation of the bare soil, or resting on a slight lining; they
  are drab or olive in colour, with roundish brown spots. What seems to be the ground colour is
  easily rubbed off before incubation commences, a fact noticeable in other Galline birds and
  Plovers. The Sage-Grouse reaches a considerable elevation, as does the sage-brush, which gives its
  name to the bird.</p>

  <p><i>Tympanuchus americanus</i>, the Prairie-hen, found in the districts drained by the
  Mississippi and its confluents, and thence northwards to Ontario, is brown above, barred with buff
  and black, and chiefly paler brown below, marked with white. The small crest is tipped with white,
  and a tuft of long, stiff, black feathers covers the inflatable yellow air-sacs on the sides of
  the neck, the sacs being absent and the tufts shorter in females. In spring parties assemble after
  daybreak on dry knolls, and conduct their love affairs after the fashion of the Dusky Grouse
  (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page236">236</a></span>), a booming noise being audible from afar,
  and the skin of the neck being expanded below the erected tufts. The cocks are most pugnacious
  when the pairing-time is nearly over. Shoots of plants, berries, grain, acorns, and insects
  constitute the food. The flight is powerful and rapid, but individuals often run and squat. For a
  Grouse the nest is considerable; and from eleven to fourteen, or even twenty, creamy or
  olive-coloured eggs are deposited, with very small reddish-brown spots. <i>T. cupido</i>, the
  Heath-Hen of the eastern United States, now only found on the island of Martha's Vineyard, off
  Massachusetts, has smaller neck-tufts of pointed feathers, and more conspicuous whitish marks on
  the scapulars. <i>T. pallidicinctus</i>, the Lesser Prairie-Hen, ranging from Texas to Kansas, is
  barred with brown, margined on each side with black.</p>

  <p><i>Dendragapus obscurus</i>, the Dusky, Blue, or Pine-Grouse of the Rocky Mountain districts,
  has black upper parts mottled with grey and a little brown, and pure grey under surface; the
  female having a considerable admixture of buff, and the male possessing air-sacs like those of
  <i>Tympanuchus</i>. A darker race, <i>D. fuliginosus</i>, extends the range to Sitka and
  California. Another northern form, which lacks the broad grey tail-band, is termed <i>D.
  richardsoni</i>. These birds frequent wooded ravines up to nine thousand feet, preferring the
  neighbourhood of water, and feeding as do their allies. The characteristic booming noise, common
  to this species and others, may be heard throughout the day in spring, the male <span
  class="pagenum" id="page236"><span class="smaller">{236}</span></span>choosing some horizontal
  bough or convenient spot of ground whereon to display himself with drooping wings, expanded tail,
  and inflated air-sacs. Rarely can an observer gain a view, so misleading is the ventriloquistic
  effect of the sound. The nest, commonly placed beneath a branch or near a tussock, is a mere
  depression in the soil lined with herbage, leaves, or fir-needles. The eight to twelve eggs are
  creamy-buff, with round brown dots.</p>

  <p><i>Canachites</i> (<i>Canace</i>) <i>canadensis</i>, the Canada Grouse or "Spruce-Partridge,"
  found from Alaska and British America to the north-eastern United States, is black, with
  lead-coloured bars above, and a white pectoral band below, the tail having a chestnut tip, which
  is wanting in the browner <i>C. franklini</i> of the north-western Rocky Mountains. In the female
  the grey is chiefly replaced by orange. It is a tame species, and flies but a short distance
  before alighting on some tree. The food consists of "spruce" buds and larch needles, with berries
  of <i>Vaccinium</i> (bilberry, cranberry, etc.), <i>Empetrum</i> (crowberry), and so forth. It is
  not polygamous; but a most curious account of the cock's habits of showing off and drumming is
  given by Bendire.<a id="NtA_165" href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> The hen constructs a nest of
  dry moss, leaves, and twigs upon the ground, under shelter of some overhanging bough, and lays
  from eight to eighteen reddish-buff eggs with brown spots. <i>Falcipennis hartlaubi</i>, a very
  similar species, distinguished by slender sickle-shaped outer primaries, occurs in North-East
  Siberia, Kamtschatka, and Saghalien.</p>

  <p><i>Tetrao urogallus</i>, the Capercaillie, apparently not uncommon in Scotland until 1770, and
  exterminated in Ireland about the same date, was reintroduced at Taymouth Park, Perthshire, in
  1838, and is now fairly plentiful in Central North Britain. Failure has attended similar attempts
  in Ireland. The discoveries of bones in Teesdale and near Torquay shew that this bird's range once
  extended to Yorkshire and Devonshire, while similar finds have been made in Aquitaine and Denmark.
  At the present day it inhabits sub-alpine pine-forests from Scandinavia, the Pyrenees, North
  Italy, and Greece to Lake Baikal and the Altai Mountains, being represented in the Urals by a
  sub-species, <i>T. uralensis</i>. The male is almost entirely blackish-grey above, with somewhat
  darker tail, and black below with greenish chest. The female is smaller, and is mottled with
  brown, buff, black, and white, merging into rufous on the breast, which is barred with black. A
  variable <span class="pagenum" id="page237"><span class="smaller">{237}</span></span>amount of
  white occurs beneath in both sexes. The brown hair-like feathers on the legs are longest in
  winter, a fact true also in the Ptarmigan and elsewhere. A cross between the hen Capercaillie and
  the Black-Cock is known in North Europe as the Rackelhahn (<i>T. medius</i>).<a id="NtA_166"
  href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> The "lek" or "spel," as the love-performance is called, has
  been described in detail by many authors;<a id="NtA_167" href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> it
  takes place in spring, and occasionally in autumn, when the excited male struts with drooping
  wings and erect outspread tail before the assembled females, uttering curious noisy cries, to
  which they reply with softer plaintive notes. He is said to be deaf during the "play." At times he
  takes up a position on some lofty bough with the evident intention of challenging his rivals, who
  quickly respond to the provocation; ere long they join in combat upon the ground, leaping and
  rushing upon one another in their blind rage, and using bills, wings, and claws as weapons of
  offence. The flight of the Capercaillie is heavy though strong. The food consists chiefly of young
  pine-shoots, which are apt to give the flesh a flavour of turpentine, but includes berries,
  insects, and worms. About a dozen yellowish-white eggs, freckled with dull orange, are deposited
  in a hole scraped for the purpose near the foot of a tree, a slight lining being sometimes added.
  <i>T. parvirostris</i> (<i>urogallo&iuml;des</i>) of North-East Siberia, with comparatively slender
  bill and purplish-green head, and <i>T. kamtschaticus</i> of Kamtschatka, are distinguished by
  their white-tipped scapulars.</p>

  <p><i>Lyrurus tetrix</i>, the Black Grouse, called according to the sex Black Cock or Grey Hen,
  ranges over Europe north of the Pyrenees and Apennines, as well as through Northern Asia to the
  Tian-Shan Mountains and Pekin. It inhabits the wilder moorlands of the north and west of England,
  being much less plentiful in the Midlands, and very rare in the east. It has, however, been
  introduced into Norfolk, and unsuccessfully into Ireland, while it has been restored to Surrey,
  Sussex, and Berks, and still occurs in Wilts, Dorset, Hants, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall. In
  Scotland it frequents most suitable districts, but does not reach Orkney, Shetland, or the Outer
  Hebrides. The male, remarkable for his lyrate tail with its outwardly curved rectrices, is black
  with steel-blue reflexions, exhibiting a little brown in parts, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page238"><span class="smaller">{238}</span></span>a white bar on the wing, and white under
  tail-coverts. The female is rufous and buff, barred and spotted with black, and shewing but little
  white. This bird is usually found on broken ground or in open woodlands, where it conceals itself
  among long heath, bracken, or grass. The polygamous cocks meet at dawn in spring to fight for the
  hens, parading before them in great excitement with depressed outspread tails, while uttering a
  drumming or cooing noise. At other times the call-note is loud and clear. The flight is powerful
  but heavy; the food includes berries, seeds, grain, shoots, buds, and insects. The nest is merely
  a scantily-lined hollow, situated at the foot of a tree, or in heather and the like, often near
  plantations. The six to ten eggs have a yellowish ground-colour, with scattered orange-brown
  blotches, the markings being larger than in the Capercaillie. In some winters these Grouse allow
  themselves to be snowed up, as occasionally do other species. <i>L. mlokosiewiczi</i> of the
  Caucasus has the rectrices only slightly curved, and black under tail-coverts. Hybrids between the
  Black Cock and the Willow Grouse are called Riporre in Scandinavia.</p>

  <p><i>Lagopus scoticus</i>, the Red Grouse or Muirfowl, the only bird entirely confined to our
  islands, differs from its congeners in never becoming white in winter. It varies considerably in
  coloration,<a id="NtA_168" href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> but is usually considered a local
  form of the Willow Grouse (<i>L. albus</i>) of the north of Europe, Asia, and America. The male in
  both summer and winter is more or less chestnut-brown above, with black markings and a reddish
  head; the lower parts are similar, but are usually spotted with white. In autumn the brown of the
  upper parts becomes buff, and the lower surface is barred with buff and black. Mr. Ogilvie Grant<a
  id="NtA_169" href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> recognises three types of plumage in the male, a
  red form with no white spots, from Ireland and Western Scotland; a blackish variety comparatively
  rarely found; and another largely spotted with white below or even above. Intermediate specimens
  constitute the bulk of our birds. The female exhibits, moreover, a buff-spotted and a buff-barred
  form; but in summer she is typically black above with concentric buff markings, and buff below
  with black bars. Her autumn plumage, which continues throughout the winter, is black, spotted with
  buff and barred with rufous.</p>

  <p>Little need be said of the habits of this well-known species, nor will space allow of a
  description of the methods of killing it by driving and so forth; but it may be observed that it
  utters a clear ringing note, us well as the familiar cok-cok-cok, and feeds upon grain and tender
  shoots of ling (<i>Calluna</i>) and heather (<i>Erica</i>), besides other plants. The nest of
  moss, grass, and the like is placed amidst heather, and contains from six to ten, or even more,
  yellowish-white eggs, thickly blotched and spotted with fine red-brown, purplish, or black. In
  England the Red Grouse is found as far south as Derbyshire and Shropshire, in Wales to Glamorgan;
  while unsuccessful attempts have been made to introduce it into Surrey and elsewhere. In Ireland
  it is rather thinly distributed, but in Scotland it reaches the Orkneys, and an occasional brood
  has been known to be reared in Shetland, where a few pairs were turned down between 1858 and 1883.
  It has also been acclimatized in Southern Sweden. <i>Lagopus albus</i>, the Willow Grouse of
  Northern Europe, Asia, and America, termed the "Dal-riporre" in Scandinavia, is completely white
  in winter, except for the lateral rectrices, which are chiefly black; in summer it resembles the
  Red Grouse, but is distinguished by the white wing-quills. The female is smaller. The habits <span
  class="pagenum" id="page240"><span class="smaller">{240}</span></span>are similar to those of the
  last-named, but a preference is shewn for willow- and birch-scrub; shoots of these trees or of
  <i>Vaccinium</i>, with various moorland berries, furnishing the food. A performance recalling the
  "lek" of the Capercaillie is said to be given by the male in spring, a fact also true of the
  succeeding species.<a id="NtA_170" href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> <i>L. mutus</i>, the
  Ptarmigan or Fjeld-riporre, is in summer blackish-brown with grey and rufous markings, the median
  tail-feathers, abdomen, and most of the wings being white. The back becomes grey in autumn. The
  female is reddish-buff, barred with black. In winter both sexes are white, with black and white
  rectrices, and in the male with black lores. Nearly all the so-called Ptarmigan in English
  poulterers' shops are Willow Grouse. The haunts are on the higher parts of mountain-ranges, where
  stony ground abounds, but somewhat lower altitudes are sought after the breeding season. The food
  consists of shoots and berries; the cry is croaking, and best heard in misty weather. From five to
  ten eggs, with blacker markings than those of Red Grouse, are deposited in a hole scraped in the
  earth, with little or no lining, the nest being commonly quite exposed, though equally often under
  shelter of a boulder. Ptarmigan are decidedly difficult to see among the similarly-coloured
  stones. In Scotland they occur on most of the higher hills from Arran northwards, though no longer
  in Dumfries and Galloway; while abroad they occupy Northern Europe, with the Pyrenees and the
  Alps, and possibly Northern Asia. In the lighter <i>L. rupestris</i> the adult male never has a
  black breast or a grey back in autumn. This form occurs in North Asia and North America, with
  Greenland, Iceland, and Japan, many local races having been described as distinct species or
  sub-species; while the larger <i>L. hyperboreus</i> (<i>hemileucurus</i>), with a white base to
  the tail, inhabits Spitsbergen; and <i>L. leucurus</i>, with entirely white rectrices&ndash;the
  smallest member of the genus&ndash;ranges along the Rocky Mountains from British Columbia to New
  Mexico.</p>

  <p>Of fossil forms <i>Coturnix</i> and <i>Palaeortyx</i> occur in the Upper Eocene of the Paris
  Basin, <i>Taoperdix</i> in the calcareous deposits of Languedoc of the same age; <i>Palaeortyx</i>
  is again found with three species of <i>Palaeoperdix</i>, in the Middle Miocene of France, while
  <i>Phasianus</i> is not only recorded from <span class="pagenum" id="page241"><span
  class="smaller">{241}</span></span>this formation, but from the Upper Miocene of Oeningen and the
  Pliocene of Attica, in the latter of which <i>Gallus</i> accompanies it. <i>Meleagris</i> has been
  discovered in the Miocene of Colorado, and the Post-pliocene of New Jersey; <i>Gallus</i> in the
  Pliocene of France, <i>Palaeotetrix</i> and <i>Pedioecetes</i> in that of Oregon; and, finally,
  bones of <i>Lagopus</i> have been brought to light in the French Plistocene, and those of
  <i>Tetrao urogallus</i> at Kent's Hole near Torquay and in the caves of Teesdale in England.</p>

  <p>Fam. VII. <b>Opisthocomidae.</b>&ndash;The curious and highly specialized Hoatzin
  (<i>Opisthocomus cristatus</i>) has been the subject of much discussion among systematists, as the
  outcome of which it is necessary to adopt for it a special Sub-Order <span
  class="sc">Opisthocomi</span>. Buffon classed it with the Curassows, P. L. S. M&uuml;ller and Gmelin
  placed it in the Linnean genus <i>Phasianus</i>; but Illiger recognised a genus
  <i>Opisthocomus</i>, while Huxley and Garrod fully admitted its claim to higher rank than that of
  a Family. The habits are to some extent Ralline, and certain points of structure indicate a
  considerable affinity to the <i>Cuculi</i>.</p>

  <p>The sternum is utterly unlike that of any other species, the anterior portion of the keel being
  aborted, and the posterior correlated with a flattened area of thick naked skin, on which the bird
  mainly rests. These modifications are no doubt connected with the extraordinarily large crop,
  which is supported by the furcula and the fore-part of the breast-bone, being received in a cavity
  of the pectoral muscles; the whole organ is decidedly muscular, and contains two divisions with a
  partial constriction between them. The body is long and thin, the bill is strong with basal
  serrations on the maxilla; bristles surround the gape, and the eye-lids have distinct
  lashes&ndash;a rare fact among birds. The reticulated metatarsi are fairly stout; the toes are
  long; the hallux being unusually developed and the claws slightly curved. The short rounded wings
  have ten primaries and nine secondaries. The nearly even tail is elongated, with ten stiff
  feathers. The plumage in both sexes is olive above with white markings, and dull rufous below; the
  long loose crest and the tip of the tail are yellowish, and a patch of bare bluish-black skin
  surrounds the eyes. The tongue is sagittate, the furcula is <span class="sans fwb">Y</span>-shaped
  and ossifies anteriorly with the coracoids, an aftershaft is present, the down of the adults is
  sparing, while a small amount&ndash;of a reddish-brown colour&ndash;is observable in the
  newly-hatched <span class="pagenum" id="page242"><span class="smaller">{242}</span></span>young.
  The syrinx has one pair of muscles inserted on the distal end of the trachea.</p>

  <p>The Hoatzin or "Anna," which is about the size of a Pigeon, ranges from Colombia to the Lower
  Amazons and Bolivia, where it haunts the sides of lagoons, creeks, and rivers covered with a thick
  growth of low trees or bushes, which project over the stream or the mud left bare by the tide. In
  these tangled solitudes it skulks during the heat of the day, while at other times it may be
  observed squatting upon the branches, mainly supported on the patch of hardened skin already
  mentioned. When disturbed the bird flies off awkwardly for some forty yards with a violent
  flapping motion, or progresses by leaps from bough to bough, erecting its crest and expanding its
  wings and tail. The note is sharp and shrill, and has been described as a hissing screech. The
  food consists of leaves and fruit of the prickly <i>Drepanocarpus lunulatus</i>, of the Aroid
  <i>Montrichardia arborescens</i>, of <i>Avicennia nitida</i>, and of a species of <i>Psidium</i>.
  The conspicuous nest, placed on low trees or shrubs, is a loose platform of spiny twigs and sticks
  with a softer lining, which contains from three to five yellowish-white eggs of a Rail-like
  appearance, spotted with reddish-brown and lilac. The young, which can see and run as soon as they
  are hatched, have a claw on both index and pollex, by means of which they creep about the thickets
  and hook themselves over the branches, assisted by the bill and feet. They can also swim and dive.
  A strong musky odour is given off by the adults, whence they are termed "Stinking Pheasants" in
  Guiana. The male has been asserted to be polygamous.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order X. GRUIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The Gruiformes, which lie between the Galliformes and the Charadriiformes, compose a somewhat
  heterogeneous Order, which includes forms so different as the <i>Rallidae</i> (Rails),
  <i>Gruidae</i> (Cranes), <i>Aramidae</i> (Limpkins), <i>Psophiidae</i> (Trumpeters),
  <i>Cariamidae</i> (Seriem&aacute; and Chu&ntilde;ia), <i>Otididae</i> (Bustards), <i>Rhinochetidae</i> (Kagu),
  <i>Eurypygidae</i> (Sun-Bitterns), and <i>Heliornithidae</i> (Finfoots). Of these a large number
  are Waders, but the Land-Rail, the Wekas, the Kagu, the Bustards, and others, cannot be classed in
  this category. All agree in having no true crop, a tracheo-bronchial syrinx, and an elevated
  hallux; while the front toes are never completely webbed, though nearly so in <i>Heliornis</i>;
  the nares, moreover, are pervious, except in <i>Rhinochetus</i>. In the last-named the condition
  of the newly-hatched young is unknown, in <i>Heliornis</i> they are said to be naked at first, but
  in the remainder of the group they are covered with simple down. In structure the nine Families
  differ widely, a fact which would seem a strong argument against combining them under one head;
  but the aggregate of such points must be considered, and in any linear system the relationships
  within every Order cannot possibly be equally close. The present arrangement does not differ
  greatly from that adopted by Mr. Sclater,<a id="NtA_171" href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a>
  wherein he accepted the names <i>Alectorides</i> and <i>Fulicariae</i>, used by Nitzsch, but made
  the former to consist of the <i>Aramidae</i>, <i>Eurypygidae</i>, <i>Gruidae</i>,
  <i>Psophiidae</i>, <i>Cariamidae</i>, and <i>Otididae</i>, and the latter of the <i>Rallidae</i>
  and <i>Heliornithidae</i>. Some writers, both modern and ancient, have placed the <i>Otididae</i>
  in the Limicoline group.</p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Rallidae.</b>&ndash;The Rails constitute a somewhat generalized and very homogeneous
  Family, found in almost all parts of the world. The body is peculiarly compressed&ndash;enabling
  them to move with ease in dense vegetation&ndash;while the keel of the sternum is especially
  reduced in those flightless forms for which the group is remarkable. The strong bill varies in
  dimensions, being long in typical Rails, shorter and thicker in Crakes, decidedly curved in
  <i>Himantornis</i>, and reaching its maximum size among the Gallinules in <i>Porphyrio</i> and
  <i>Notornis</i>, where it is subconical. A horny shield is present upon the forehead in
  <i>Megacrex</i>, <i>Habroptila</i>, the Gallinules and the Coots, which is usually rounded or
  truncated <span class="pagenum" id="page244"><span class="smaller">{244}</span></span>posteriorly,
  but is reduced to a point in <i>Porphyriops</i>. This excrescence is in most cases red, but is
  sky-blue, light green, or dusky in <i>Porphyriola</i>, green in <i>Tribonyx</i>, blackish in
  <i>Megacrex</i>, white, yellow, or brown in <i>Fulica</i>. The lower part of the tibia is bare;
  the anteriorly scutellated metatarsus is seldom short, though occasionally very stout; the toes
  are long and slender with the elevated hallux weakest; the claws are fairly long, curved, and
  sharp. Somewhat shorter digits are found in <i>Tribonyx</i> and <i>Pareudiastes</i>, <i>Fulica</i>
  has broad lobes of skin along the front toes, while <i>Porphyriops</i> and <i>Gallinula</i> have
  narrow entire membranous margins to them. The wings are generally short and rounded, with ten or
  eleven primaries, and from eleven to sixteen secondaries, all the feathers being obtuse; but in
  many species these members are imperfectly developed, and their coverts actually hide the quills
  in such cases as <i>Ocydromus</i> and <i>Notornis</i>. This retrograde tendency is clearly
  evidenced in the "Island Hen" of Tristan da Cunha (<i>Gallinula</i> or <i>Porphyriornis
  nesiotis</i>) and the Mountain Cock of Gough Island (<i>G. comeri</i>), which flutter along
  without flying; in the Moho of Hawaii (<i>Pennula ecaudata</i>), <i>Ocydromus</i> and
  <i>Notornis</i> of New Zealand, and <i>Habroptila wallacii</i> of Halmahera; not to mention
  <i>Eulabeornis</i>, <i>Porzanula</i>, <i>Nesolimnas</i>, <i>Cabalus</i>, <i>Pareudiastes</i>, and
  the extinct <i>Aphanapteryx</i>, <i>Aptornis</i>, <i>Diaphorapteryx</i>, and <i>Erythromachus</i>.
  In several flightless forms, as in the Dodo, the angle between the scapula and the coracoid is
  obtuse. The tail has from ten to fourteen rectrices, the usual number being twelve; these are
  short and usually soft, frequently with decomposed webs, and may be concealed by the coverts, as
  in <i>Megacrex</i>, <i>Amurolimnas</i>, and <i>Pennula</i>. Its form varies from narrow and
  pointed to comparatively broad and rounded. A large caruncle rises behind the frontal shield in
  <i>Gallicrex</i> and <i>Fulica cornuta</i>, two knobs being found there in <i>F. cristata</i>: the
  wing, moreover, is often armed with a sharp spine. The nasal grooves are commonly long and deep;
  the pervious nostrils being in the hard sheath of the bill in Gallinules, and partially covered by
  a bony or horny growth in <i>Rallicula</i>, <i>Pareudiastes</i>, and <i>Thyrorhina</i>. The
  furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the tongue lanceolate, the aftershaft very
  small. Down is plentiful in both adults and young, that of the nestlings being commonly black,
  while the chicks of our Moor-Hen and Coot have the head adorned with red and blue. Rails, not
  being born blind, run from the shell, and swim at once.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page245"><span class="smaller">{245}</span></span></div>

  <p>Ralline birds are under ordinary circumstances non-gregarious, and inhabit tangled marshes or
  damp localities near rivers and lakes; but many, and especially the flightless forms, have a
  predilection for dry plains, as for instance <i>Pennula</i> of Hawaii, <i>Ocydromus</i> of New
  Zealand, <i>Cabalus</i> of the Chatham Islands, <i>Habroptila</i> of Halmahera,
  <i>Tricholimnas</i> of New Caledonia, and <i>Pareudiastes</i> of Samoa. <i>Crex pratensis</i> of
  the Palaearctic Region also haunts dry lands. <i>Fulica gigantea</i> occurs only on the lakes in
  the Andes of Chili, Bolivia, and Peru. Some species are partly crepuscular, and in Britain the
  Spotted Crake is certainly little heard except towards evening. Rails walk easily with bobbing
  head and jerking tail, while they prefer running to flying, as the flight is laboured and requires
  continuous action of the wings. As may be readily seen in the case of Coots and Moor-Hens, some
  difficulty is experienced in rising from water, the feet trailing along the surface for several
  yards; but, when once fairly launched in the air, the legs, which at first hang down, are drawn up
  below the tail, and a steady pace is maintained for considerable distances. Most species swim and
  dive with facility, and will even remain with only the bill above water; perching and climbing,
  too, are common habits. Generally speaking, the members of this Family are silent birds, though
  they may be constantly heard calling towards dusk; the more or less melancholy notes are less
  varied than in many other groups, but may be harsh and sonorous, or loud and clear. The groaning
  noise uttered by the breeding Water-Rail, the somewhat frog-like sound made by the Moor-Hen, the
  continuous craking of the Corn-Crake, the "cackling" of the Clapper-Rail, the shrill whistle of
  the Wekas, the rasping cry of <i>Ocydromus sylvestris</i>, the deep trumpeting of the Purple
  Gallinule, and the clearer call of the Coot are some of the most notable exceptions. The food
  consists of worms, molluscs, insects and their larvae, green herbage, tubers, roots of aquatic
  plants and seeds; <i>Porphyrio</i> and <i>Tribonyx</i> cause serious damage to potato-, rice-, and
  corn-crops: while the former bird is said to have a curious habit of holding the larger edibles in
  its claws and nibbling them like a Parrot. Some of the stronger species occasionally prey on mice,
  lizards, young birds, and eggs. The nest may be a large mass of aquatic plants or dry flags, as in
  the Coots, or a similar but smaller structure, as in the Gallinules; the former being commonly
  founded under water, though raised above it, whereas the latter is generally near the bank <span
  class="pagenum" id="page246"><span class="smaller">{246}</span></span>or&ndash;exceptionally&ndash;at
  the height of a few feet in a tree or bush. Rails and Crakes make a more or less substantial
  fabric in sedges, grass, clover, and so forth, <i>Creciscus</i> and <i>Porzanula</i> a spherical
  mass with an entrance at the side; but <i>Pareudiastes</i>, <i>Cabalus</i>, and <i>Ocydromus</i>
  are stated to breed in most cases in burrows. <i>Gallicrex</i> occasionally fashions its nest on
  floating leaves, and the writer has seen a Moor-Hen's nest in a similar situation. The eggs, from
  two to ten or more in number, are generally white or cream-coloured with red-brown, olive, or
  blackish markings, and often with faint lilac spots; those of the Coot are stone-drab with small
  black specks; those of <i>Cabalus modestus</i> are white with a few indistinct rufous and grey
  flecks; those of <i>Zapornia parva</i> and <i>Porzana bailloni</i> are instances of a thick
  olive-brown mottling. The adults are stated sometimes to carry their young in their claws.</p>

  <p>Exceptionally the plumage of the Rallidae is nearly black, as in <i>Limnocorax</i>,
  <i>Fulica</i>, and <i>Habroptila</i>; slightly browner, as in Gallinula; blue or greenish-blue as
  in <i>Porphyrio</i>: but the coloration is normally sober, with a tendency to olive, brown, or
  chestnut. This may be relieved by stripes of white, especially on the flanks; the under parts may
  be nearly red as in <i>Creciscus levraudi</i>; and both surfaces may be spotted with white as in
  the male of <i>Corethrura pulchra</i>, or flecked and barred with it, as in <i>Rallus
  maculatus</i>. The sexes are usually alike, but <i>Rallicula</i>, <i>Zapornia</i>,
  <i>Gallicrex</i>, and <i>Corethrura</i> are instances of the contrary.</p>

  <p>Space, however, is wanting to give in detail a description of every form, which is the less
  necessary in view of their general similarity; but the following examples will enable a fair idea
  to be gained of the group.</p>

  <p><i>Rallus aquaticus</i>, the Water Rail of Europe and Central Asia, which winters in North-West
  India and North Africa, is olive-brown above with darker streaks, and lead-coloured below, the
  flanks being barred with black and white. The genus is found in most parts of the world, with the
  apparent exception of North-West Africa and the Australian Region. <i>Rallus elegans</i>, the
  King-Rail, <i>R. longirostris</i> (<i>crepitans</i>), the Clapper-Rail, and <i>R. virginianus</i>
  are well-known North American species, while <i>R. madagascariensis</i> is confined to
  Madagascar.</p>

  <p>In <i>Hypotaenidia</i>, which ranges from India and South China to the Pacific Islands
  generally, the whole lower parts are barred with black and white, except in <i>H. striata</i> and
  <i>H. m&uuml;lleri</i>, where <span class="pagenum" id="page247"><span
  class="smaller">{247}</span></span>these markings are restricted to the sides and abdominal
  region, and in <i>H. brachypus</i>, where the belly is plain.</p>

  <p><i>Cabalus modestus</i> and <i>Nesolimnas dieffenbachi</i> of the Chatham Islands are curious
  little brown forms with no visible tail, closely allied to the next genus, which they resemble in
  being flightless, and apparently in general habits. <i>Ocydromus</i> contains the Wood-Hens, or
  Weka Rails, of New Zealand, of which <i>O. greyi</i> of the North Island is tawny above with dark
  shaft-stripes or bars, and grey below with fulvous fore-neck and sides. <i>O. carli</i> of the
  South Island is more cinnamon in hue; <i>O. australis</i>, also of the South Island, is less grey
  below, and usually has barred flanks; <i>O. fuscus</i> of the south-west of the South Island is
  blacker than the first-named; <i>O. hectori</i> is a paler race of <i>O. australis</i>. These
  Rails are semi-nocturnal, and sometimes excavate burrows, in which, or in the scrub, they pass
  much of the day; the localities preferred are dry woods, ravines, and sandy shores, <i>O.
  fuscus</i> obtaining the name of Kelp-Hen from the stretches of sea-weed that it frequents. This
  species feeds on sea-molluscs, but its congeners will eat young birds, lizards, caterpillars,
  worms, insects, and berries. The cry is a sharp whistle, often preceded by a growl, the birds
  being very tame when unmolested. They are pugnacious, inquisitive, and thievish, stealing articles
  from tents or houses, attacking fowls, or sucking their eggs. Their own eggs are from five to
  seven, both these and the nest, which is generally in a burrow, much resembling those of other
  Rails. <i>Ocydromus sylvestris</i>, of Lord Howe Island, is nearly uniform rufous above and
  brownish below, with barred wings and tail; it lays similar eggs upon the ground.</p>

  <p>The dusky <i>Tricholimnas lafresnayi</i> of New Caledonia is remarkable for its soft hair-like
  plumage, and the purplish-brown and black <i>Gymnocrex rosenbergi</i> of Celebes for its bare
  yellowish orbits.</p>

  <p><i>Aramides</i> includes eight species found in Central and South America, of which <i>A.
  ypecaha</i> may be taken as a representative. It is olive-green above, with chestnut nape, black
  rump and tail, and greyish below with white throat and vinous belly; the bill is yellow, the feet
  are scarlet. Cautious when danger threatens, it is sufficiently audacious to attack poultry; among
  its native swamps it usually walks in stately style or struts on the branches of trees, though it
  can run quickly; while it lies closely when surprised on open ground, dashing up with the whirring
  flight of a Partridge. The alarm-note is powerful, unearthly shrieks being uttered <span
  class="pagenum" id="page248"><span class="smaller">{248}</span></span>during both day and night.
  Companies are described by Mr. Hudson as meeting to dance about with expanded wings and open
  beaks.<a id="NtA_172" href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> Somewhat similar in colour to certain
  members of the last genus is <i>Megacrex inepta</i> of South New Guinea, one of the largest Rails
  known, which is usually seen running swiftly along water-courses; while the black <i>Habroptila
  wallacii</i> of Halmahera loves forests. The curious <i>Himantornis haematopus</i> of West Africa
  is brown, with black and rufous mottlings above, whitish throat, stout green and black bill, and
  red feet. <i>Dryolimnas cuvieri</i> of Madagascar, Mauritius, and Aldabra Island, and
  <i>Canirallus kiolo&iuml;des</i> of the first-named and West Africa must be briefly mentioned, as must
  <i>Rallina</i> reaching from India to North-East Australia, which has half a dozen small brown
  species, with chestnut on the head and chest, and black and white barring below.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Crex pratensis</i>, the widely-ranging Corn-Crake or Land-Rail, extends from most of Europe
  to the north of Central Asia, wintering in Africa, and occurring accidentally in North America, or
  even Greenland and Australia. <i>Zapornia parva</i>, the Little Crake, <i>Porzana maruetta</i>,
  the Spotted Crake, and <i>P. bailloni</i>, Baillon's Crake, are somewhat similar British Birds,
  the two latter of which have bred in our islands, <i>P. maruetta</i> still doing so in some
  districts. This species is brownish-olive with white flecks above and below, grey belly, and
  flanks showing black and white bars. Of its dozen congeners, covering nearly the whole globe,
  <i>P. carolina</i>, the Sora Rail of North America, is particularly well-known. In the Ethiopian
  genus <i>Corethrura</i>, extending to Madagascar, the males are blackish, spotted or streaked with
  white, and have fine chestnut heads, necks, or even breasts, the female being dusky with rufous
  mottlings: in <i>Rallicula</i> of New Guinea the chestnut extends over most of the body.
  <i>Porzanula</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page249"><span
  class="smaller">{249}</span></span><i>palmeri</i> of Laysan, an interesting little flightless form
  with a soft chirping note, which the first discoverer caught with a hand-net, makes its nest under
  grass-tussocks. Closely allied to <i>Porzana</i> is <i>Creciscus</i>, a genus of a dozen species
  ranging from the United States to the Gal&aacute;pagos, Chili, and Paraguay; two at least of them being
  remarkable for building a spherical nest with a side entrance in coarse herbage or low bushes,
  while one is said to make a sort of ladder to reach a platform before its porch.<a id="NtA_173"
  href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> <i>Limnocorax niger</i> of the Ethiopian Region is a glossy
  black bird with red feet and greenish bill, which walks upon the leaves of water-lilies and such
  plants, like a Ja&ccedil;ana.</p>

  <p><i>Amaurornis</i>, inhabiting the Oriental Region and extending to New Britain, links the
  foregoing genera to the Gallinules. <i>A. phoenicura</i> is a dark greyish bird with white under
  parts and chestnut flanks, the other three species being duller.</p>

  <p><i>Tribonyx mortieri</i>, the "Native Hen" of Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania, and
  <i>T. ventralis</i> of considerably wider range, are respectively ruddy- and olive-brown forms,
  with blackish tail and vent, slaty lower surface, and white flank-marks. They appear at times in
  flocks, which arrive and depart with equal suddenness, destroy the settlers' crops, strut about
  like fowls, and in many respects resemble Moor-Hens in habits, nests, and eggs. The legs are
  unusually powerful.</p>

  <p><i>Gallinula</i> extends over the greater part of both hemispheres, and is represented in
  Europe, Asia, and Africa by our common Moor-Hen (<i>G. chloropus</i>), dark olive-brown above and
  grey below, with white lower tail-coverts, white flank-stripes, red frontal plate, and scarlet
  garter on the tibia. <i>G. galeata</i> of most of the New World differs in the posteriorly
  truncated shield, but <i>G. sandvicensis</i> of the Sandwich Islands is barely separable. The
  smaller African <i>G. angulata</i>, <i>G. tenebrosa</i> of Australia and New Guinea, and <i>G.
  frontata</i> of the two last-named countries, the Moluccas and Borneo, complete the group; unless
  <i>G. pyrrhorhoa</i> of Madagascar and <i>G. dionysiana</i> of St. Denys be accounted distinct
  from <i>G. chloropus</i>. The flightless <i>G.</i> (<i>Porphyriornis</i>) <i>nesiotis</i> of
  Tristan da Cunha and <i>G. comeri</i> of Gough Island have already been mentioned. <i>Gallicrex
  cinerea</i>, the "Water-Cock" of the Indian Region, which reaches Japan, is dull black, with
  lighter edges to the feathers above, a yellow and red bill, and red frontal shield. A pinkish
  <span class="pagenum" id="page250"><span class="smaller">{250}</span></span>fleshy horn springs
  from the forehead, said to become very small in winter, and to be wanting in the female, which is
  varied below with white and buff. It has a loud booming cry, and fights like a domestic Cock, but
  otherwise resembles the Gallinules in habits.</p>

  <p><i>Porphyrio</i> comprises some dozen fine species with blue plumage, found in Africa and
  Madagascar, and from the Mediterranean to South China and Polynesia; several individuals, probably
  escaped from captivity, being recorded from Britain. <i>P. caeruleus</i> (<i>veterum</i>) is
  purplish-blue above with blacker remiges and rectrices, and purplish-black below with bright blue
  cheeks, throat, and chest, and white under tail-coverts; the bill, shield, and feet are red. It is
  chiefly a Mediterranean bird, but reaches Mesopotamia. Others of its congeners are greener or
  blacker. The habits, nest, and eggs are like those of the Coot, whereas the next genus&ndash;in
  the writer's opinion inseparable&ndash;appears more akin in manners to the Moor-Hen.
  <i>Porphyriola alleni</i> occurs in Africa, with Madagascar and Rodriguez, and strays to the
  Canary Islands and South Europe; <i>P. martinica</i> ranges from Florida, Texas, or even New
  England, to the West Indies and Brazil; <i>P. parva</i>, from the last-named to Amazonia and
  Guiana. <i>Porphyriops crassirostris</i> and <i>P. melanops</i> occupy South America.</p>

  <p><i>Notornis mantelli</i> of New Zealand,<a id="NtA_174" href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> now
  probably extinct, was olive-green above with only a tinge of blue; the head, neck, and under
  surface being dark purplish-blue, the bill, shield, and feet red. It was practically a gigantic
  <i>Porphyrio</i> with very stout legs, short wings, and soft tail, which was unable to fly, but
  ran with great swiftness, being solitary and retiring. Its native name Moho is that also given to
  other Rails in New Zealand, and <i>Pennula ecaudata</i> in Hawaii; it therefore may only mean
  "Rail." The white <i>N. alba</i> of Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands certainly exists no longer.</p>

  <p><i>Fulica</i> includes twelve species, of which the majority are South American, though the
  genus extends over most of the globe; Polynesia possesses only <i>F. alai</i> of the Sandwich
  Islands, but three of the members reach Patagonia. <i>F. atra</i>, our grey-black Coot, with
  flesh-coloured bill, white shield and greenish legs relieved by an orange garter, ranges through
  Europe and Asia, and to North Africa and the Philippines southwards; its habits are well-known,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page251"><span class="smaller">{251}</span></span>while the lobed toes
  are noticed above. The smaller <i>F. lugubris</i> of Sumatra, Java, and Celebes is hardly
  distinct; the North American <i>F. americana</i> and the Australian <i>F. australis</i> are very
  similar; the Andean <i>F. gigantea</i> is extremely large; while the red frontal caruncles of the
  Bolivian <i>F. cornuta</i> and of the African and South-European <i>F. cristata</i> have already
  been mentioned.</p>

  <p>Of fossil Rallidae an extraordinary number are found, ranging from the possibly toothed
  <i>Telmatornis</i> of the American Cretaceous rocks, <i>Gypsornis</i>, <i>Orthnocnemus</i>,
  <i>Elaphrocnemus</i>, and <i>Tapinopus</i> of the French Upper Eocene, and <i>Rallus</i> of both
  Eocene and Miocene of the same country, to <i>Fulica minor</i> of the Pliocene of Oregon. Of more
  recently exterminated forms we have <i>Tribonyx</i> (?) <i>roberti</i> from Central Madagascar,
  the long-billed flightless <i>Aphanapteryx broecki</i> and <i>Fulica newtoni</i> from the Mare aux
  Songes in Mauritius, <i>Porphyrio caerulescens</i> from R&eacute;union, and the "Poule Rouge"
  (<i>Erythromachus leguati</i>) from Rodriguez. In New Zealand are found the large <i>Aptornis
  defossor</i> and <i>A. otidiformis</i>, with two species of <i>Notornis</i>; in the Chatham
  Islands <i>Diaphorapteryx hawkinsi</i> and <i>Ocydromus insignis</i>&ndash;all six flightless; in
  the latter islands, too, an extinct <i>Fulica</i> (<i>Palaeolimnas</i>) occurs, and in Norfolk and
  Lord Howe Islands <i>Notornis alba</i>, as above. Queensland furnishes <i>Porphyrio
  mackintoshi</i>, <i>P. reperta</i>, <i>Tribonyx effluxus</i>, <i>Gallinula strenuipes</i>, <i>G.
  peralata</i>, and <i>Fulica prior</i>. The Sandwich Islands may possibly yet contain <i>Rallus
  sandvicensis</i> and <i>Pennula ecaudata</i>, further instances of flightless species, but this is
  improbable.</p>

  <p>Fam. II. <b>Gruidae.</b>&ndash;The Cranes are very old forms, superficially somewhat like
  Herons, and often confounded with them in local parlance&ndash;as is the case in Scotland and
  Ireland. They are among the largest of Waders, and are scattered over most of the globe, except
  the Malay islands, Papuasia, and Polynesia; but in the Neotropical Region they are mere migrants
  from the north, never found south of Mexico. Their headquarters are in North-East Asia, while
  America possesses only three species, and Australia one.</p>

  <p>These long-necked and long-legged birds have a moderate bill, straight and rather compressed,
  which varies from slender to stout, with a lateral groove on each side of the mandible and nasal
  furrows about halfway down the maxilla; in <i>Balearica</i> this feature is comparatively short.
  The metatarsus is scutellated in front, reticulated behind; the tibia is partly bare; the toes are
  short and stout, the anterior being more or less connected at the base by a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page252"><span class="smaller">{252}</span></span>membrane; the hallux is small, much
  elevated, and furnished with a sharp hooked claw. The wings are described by different writers as
  long or moderate, but are certainly ample and rounded, with about thirty-three quills, of which
  eleven are primaries; the decomposed inner secondaries exceed the last-named, and are either
  lanceolate and drooping, or broad and erectile, while in <i>Bugeranus</i> and <i>Tetrapteryx</i>
  they are extraordinarily extended. The short tail has twelve rectrices. <i>Anthropo&iuml;des</i> has
  long silky auricular plumes, <i>Balearica</i> a bristly crest and a naked gular wattle,
  <i>Bugeranus</i> a feathered lappet on each side of the throat, <i>Antigone australasiana</i> a
  pendulous pouch, and most species, as will be seen below, a partly bare carunculated head. The
  tongue is lanceolate, the nostrils pervious; while, except in <i>Balearica</i>, the trachea of the
  adult is convoluted within the keel of the sternum, but enters it behind the
  clavicles,&ndash;which are often ancylosed with it,&ndash;and not in front of them, as in certain
  Swans, the development varying according to the species and the age. In <i>Anthropo&iuml;des</i> the
  cavity of the keel is open laterally. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">Y</span>-shaped, the
  aftershaft is very small, the down is uniform in both adults and young.</p>

  <p>Cranes are inhabitants of morasses and plains, being especially fond of the neighbourhood of
  lagoons, tanks, and fields of corn or rice; yet they are also found in boggy openings in forests,
  on sandy flats, or even on the sea-shore. They are gregarious after the breeding season, when they
  often collect into flocks of immense size, which pass the night together and traverse vast
  distances in company. The northern species all migrate southwards in winter. Erect and tall, they
  may be seen striding swiftly along with head thrown back, or strutting around their mates; while
  in spring they often stand in rows and proceed to stalk about in single file, or dance to meet one
  another with nodding heads, necks advanced, and wings widely outspread. Thereafter they bow
  towards the ground, jump in the air, and perform graceful antics of all descriptions. The chosen
  spot for these dances is commonly near water. The male courts his spouse in somewhat similar
  fashion, and twigs or feathers are often tossed in the air in sport, to be caught again ere they
  touch the ground. Rising from a level spot appears to be a difficult matter, the birds running
  awkwardly for a few yards, and labouring heavily with their wings to gain their purpose; when once
  in the air, however, the flight is steady and swift, with head <span class="pagenum"
  id="page253"><span class="smaller">{253}</span></span>and legs outstretched, though this is varied
  by countless elegant evolutions and gyrations, as they rise higher and higher until they become
  mere specks in the heavens, and finally disappear from sight. The characteristic utterance is a
  harsh guttural or resonant trumpeting sound, uttered on the ground with the head thrown back and
  the bill open, or repeated incessantly at great elevations; but the Whooping Crane has a clear,
  piercing cry, the Asiatic White Crane a feeble but mellow whistle, and the Crowned Cranes a
  plaintive but fairly sonorous set of notes. The varying calibre of the voice has been thought to
  be connected with the convolutions of the trachea mentioned above, the young giving vent to a weak
  pipe or trill. Virgil's lines concerning the noise made before rain, and the flight, are
  well-known to Latin scholars. The food consists of grain, pulse, acorns, shoots, flowers, roots,
  tubers, bulbs, and the like, with the occasional addition of small mammals and birds, reptiles,
  amphibians, worms, insects, and even fish; the members of this Family, however, dislike wading,
  and only swim under compulsion. Feeding chiefly in the morning and evening, when they post
  sentinels, as Rooks do, they often stand or doze upon one leg, with the head drawn back upon the
  shoulders. Cranes, which are said to pair for life, return to the same breeding haunts annually,
  where they either construct a large fabric of reeds, rushes, and aquatic herbage, or use straw and
  small twigs for their nest. The conical pile, with its moderate depression on the top, is commonly
  placed in shallows, fresh materials being added if the water rises. Several species, on the other
  hand, merely scrape a hole in marshy ground, on dry plains, among standing corn or grass, or on
  sandy beaches, while occasionally reed-beds are selected. The eggs, two, or rarely three in
  number, are generally creamy white, olive-brown or buff, with reddish-brown, red, or purplish-grey
  spots and blotches; those of the Indian Sarus Cranes have a bluish- or greenish-white ground,
  while those of the Crowned Cranes are not uncommonly plain bluish-white. The male is said to
  incubate in some cases, and both parents tend the young carefully for a considerable time, though
  the latter run from the shell; the female sits with her head drawn in upon her shoulders, and is
  usually loth to leave her charge. When wounded these birds are very dangerous, fighting boldly
  with bill and wings. They are very palatable when fed on grain, the breast in particular <span
  class="pagenum" id="page254"><span class="smaller">{254}</span></span>resembling beef-steak.
  Cranes are easily domesticated, and, in certain districts of India, in Japan, and among the
  Kalmuks, they are held in reverence, though elsewhere they are often killed for the sake of their
  decorative plumes.</p>

  <p><i>Grus communis</i>, the Common Crane of Europe and Northern Asia, which used to breed in
  Britain until the end of the sixteenth century, and reaches North Africa, India, and China on the
  winter migration, is ashy-grey, with white cheeks, nape, and sides of the neck, black primaries
  and inner secondaries; the crown being bare, with blackish bristles and red warty skin. <i>G.
  lilfordi</i> of East Siberia is a lighter race. <i>G. canadensis</i> is a smaller species, hardly
  different from <i>G. mexicana</i>, the "Sandhill Crane" of the United States, which is slaty-grey,
  with a brownish wash. <i>G. monachus</i>, another similar form from Eastern Asia, has all the head
  white except the bare portion. <i>G. nigricollis</i> of Koko-nor has the feathered part of the
  head, the upper neck, the wings, tail, and inner secondaries black; <i>G. japonensis</i> of North
  Eastern Asia is white, with grey-black throat and fore-neck, the dark colour extending to a point
  on the hind-neck. <i>G.</i> (<i>Limnogeranus</i>) <i>americana</i>, the Whooping Crane of the
  United States and Mexico, is pure white with black primaries, the bristly head, lores, and cheeks
  being bare, and covered with warty red skin. <i>G.</i> (<i>Sarcogeranus</i>) <i>leucogeranus</i>,
  the Asiatic White Crane, is entirely white, except for the black primaries, and has all the front
  of the head bare, the red skin extending beyond the eye, and showing a few scattered hairs. This
  bird ranges at certain seasons to South-East Europe. <i>G.</i> (<i>Antigone</i>) <i>collaris</i>
  of India and the Caspian is light grey, with brownish-black primaries, a white ring round the
  lower neck, and white inner secondaries; the grey-green crown is bare, the occiput and upper neck
  are red and papillose, with black bristles on the latter. The Burmo-Malay <i>G. sharpii</i> is
  distinguished by the absence of white; while both enjoy in common the name Sarus. <i>G.</i>
  (<i>A.</i>) <i>australasiana</i>, the "Native Companion" of East Australia, has the neck
  feathered, and possesses a red and green gular pouch, covered with the same black hairs as the
  face, the general coloration resembling that of its congeners. <i>G.</i> (<i>Pseudogeranus</i>)
  <i>leucauchen</i>, the "Tan-cho" or national Crane of the Japanese, part of the crown and the
  cheeks bare, warty, and red, with black hairs. often seen in their clever drawings, is grey, with
  white hind-crown, nape, throat, and inner secondaries; the rest of the wing-quills and the tip of
  the tail are black, the fore-part of the crown and the cheeks bare, warty, and red, with black
  hairs.</p>

  <p>It is found westward to Lake Baikal, and southward in winter to the Yangtse basin. <i>G.</i>
  (<i>Bugeranus</i>) <i>carunculata</i>, the Wattled Crane of South Africa, is slaty-coloured,
  becoming blacker towards the tail, and browner towards the mantle; the cheeks and the whole neck
  are white, with elongated chest plumes; a lappet, with white feathering, hangs from each side of
  the throat; and the fore-part of the head is covered with bare red papillose skin. <i>G.</i>
  (<i>Tetrapteryx</i>) <i>paradisea</i>, the "Stanley" Crane of the same districts, is leaden blue,
  with black ends to the inner secondaries, and a white crown; the head is entirely feathered, and
  the chest plumes elongated as in the next species. <i>G.</i> (<i>Anthropo&iuml;des</i>) <i>virgo</i>,
  the "Demoiselle" Crane, inhabits South Europe, and extends to Central Asia and North China,
  migrating to <span class="pagenum" id="page256"><span class="smaller">{256}</span></span>Northern
  Africa and India in winter. It is silvery-grey, with white ear-tufts, black sides of the head,
  neck, chest, primaries, and tips to the inner secondaries. <i>Balearica pavonina</i>, the Crowned
  Crane of the northern Ethiopian Region, is greenish-black above and dark grey below, most of the
  feathers being lanceolate; the neck is delicate grey all round, the secondaries are
  chestnut&ndash;the inner being somewhat decomposed; white and yellow shew on the wing-coverts; a
  spreading tuft of twisted yellow and white bristles with black tips surmounts the occiput, while
  the sides of the face are bare&ndash;white above and pink below, and the throat is covered with
  black down. There is a very small throat-wattle in this form, but <i>B. chrysopelargus</i>, the
  Kaffir Crane of South Africa, has it much larger and chiefly red, differing moreover in its greyer
  plumage, and white cheek-patch with only a border of crimson above. In <i>B. gibbericeps</i> of
  East Africa, the bare skin of the face extends almost to the nape.</p>

  <p>In Cranes the sexes are alike; but the young are browner, with rusty or buff tips to the
  feathers, or even with downy instead of more or less naked heads, as in adults. Immature birds
  lack the elongated plumes. The bill is usually greenish-grey, brown, or black, at times with a
  little red, but it is yellow in <i>Limnogeranus</i>; the feet vary from greyish- or bluish-black
  to dull green or flesh-colour; the iris is generally crimson, orange, or yellow.</p>

  <p>The Upper Eocene of Hampshire furnishes the fossil <i>Geranopsis</i> as well as <i>Grus</i>,
  the Italian Eocene <i>Palaeogrus</i>, that of Wyoming four species of <i>Aletornis</i>; Grus
  occurs, moreover, in the Miocene of France, the Pliocene of Attica and the United States, while
  <i>G. primigenia</i> of the French and Italian Plistocene, with <i>G. melitensis</i> of the Zebbug
  cave in Malta, complete the list.</p>

  <p>Fam. III. <b>Aramidae.</b>&ndash;In this group, as in the <i>Psophiidae</i> (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page257">257</a></span>), the osteology and pterylography are Crane-like,
  the digestive organs and style of plumage Rail-like; a link being thus formed between the two
  Families. The long, hard bill is slender and compressed, with slightly curved tip; the tibia is
  partly bare, the metatarsus scutellated. The wing has eleven primaries and some dozen secondaries.
  The long tongue is said to end in horny filaments, the trachea is sometimes convoluted in males,
  the nostrils are pervious.</p>

  <p><i>Aramus pictus</i>, the Clucking Hen or Limpkin of the Greater Antilles, South Florida, and
  Central America, is chocolate-brown <span class="pagenum" id="page257"><span
  class="smaller">{257}</span></span>with white flecks; the upper parts are glossed with
  bronzy-purple, the bill is greenish. <i>A. scolopaceus</i>, the Carau, Courlan, Lamenting Bird, or
  Crazy Widow, ranging from Guiana to Argentina, has only the head and neck streaked. Generally
  solitary or found in family-parties, these birds conceal themselves by day among reeds or damp
  forest-vegetation; they rise with difficulty after a preliminary run, and take low, brief flights,
  the legs hanging down and the wings flapping slowly, while the latter are elevated for a descent.
  They walk quickly and in stately fashion, limping and jerking the tail; at night they roost on
  trees. The resonant, melancholy wail is varied by a clucking note, or by an angry cry when
  breeding. The shallows of streams or marshes are diligently searched for molluscs, which the
  formation of the beak enables the bird easily to open or break, but small reptiles, insects, and
  worms are also eaten. The flat nest of herbage, placed among reeds, contains from ten to twelve
  white eggs, as large as those of a Turkey, clouded with pale brown and purple.<a id="NtA_175"

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Fam. IV. <b>Psophiidae.</b>&ndash;The so-called Trumpeters form a single genus of six species
  inhabiting tropical South America, and somewhat resemble long-necked and long-legged Fowls, the
  beak being gallinaceous and the tibia partly bare. The long metatarsi are scutellated in front;
  the wings and tail are short, the ten primaries, <span class="pagenum" id="page258"><span
  class="smaller">{258}</span></span>just equalling the twelve secondaries. The nostrils are
  pervious. The downy nestlings are chestnut streaked with grey.</p>

  <p><i>Psophia crepitans</i>, the Agami, ranging from British Guiana to Amazonia, is a black bird
  with velvety plumage on the head and neck, and lax feathering below; a golden-green and violet
  sheen adorns the lower fore-neck, a rusty brown patch crosses the back and wing-coverts, the bare
  orbits are pinkish, the beak is greenish or greyish, and the legs are variously stated to be
  bright green or flesh-coloured. <i>P. napensis</i> of Ecuador has the sheen on the neck dull
  purple, <i>P. leucoptera</i> of Peru and Upper Amazonia lacks the brown above, and has the inner
  wing-coverts and inner secondaries white, these feathers being ochraceous in <i>P. ochroptera</i>
  of the right bank of the Rio Negro. <i>P. viridis</i> of Amazonia&ndash;from Par&aacute; up the right
  bank of the Rio Madeira to the Rio Mamor&eacute;&ndash;perhaps identical with <i>P. obscura</i>, has the
  back and inner secondaries glossed with green. The sexes are similar.</p>

  <p>These birds love moist forests, and sometimes form flocks of three hundred individuals; they
  are so sociable and easily tamed that the natives use them to protect poultry. They perch, but
  seldom fly, and run swiftly with a peculiar gait, while they swim on an emergency. The deep-toned
  ventriloquistic, but not strictly trumpeting, cry is uttered with widely opened beak; the food
  consists of fruit, corn, and insects. The nest, said to be at the foot of a tree, contains creamy-
  or greyish-white eggs, like those of a Bantam.</p>

  <p>Fam. V. <b>Cariamidae.</b>&ndash;These birds have given rise to much discussion, and have been
  placed by several authors in the Accipitres, near the Secretary-Bird, which they somewhat resemble
  in their erect carriage, general appearance, and habits. The beak is short, broad, and slightly
  hooked, the neck is rather long, the legs decidedly so; the tibia is partially bare, the
  metatarsus is entirely scutellated, the claws are sharp and curved. The wings are short, with
  fourteen elongated secondaries and ten primaries; the long, graduated tail has twelve rectrices.
  The nostrils are pervious. The internal anatomy and pterylosis are Gruine, an aftershaft is
  present, and the downy young are either grey and brown (<i>Cariama</i>) or rufous and black
  (<i>Chunga</i>). <i>Cariama cristata</i>, the Seriem&aacute;, or Crested Screamer (<span class="wnw">p.
  <a href="#page110">110</a></span>), extending from Pernambuco to Paraguay and Matto Grosso, is
  ochreous-grey above with zigzag umber markings, and whitish below with brown stripes. Vertical
  feathers on the lores form a conspicuous crest, while those of the neck and throat <span
  class="pagenum" id="page259"><span class="smaller">{259}</span></span>are long and loose;
  interrupted white bands cross the remiges, and the bases and tips of the lateral rectrices. The
  iris is yellow, the beak and feet are red, the naked orbits greenish. The female is yellower, and
  exhibits less crest. <i>Chunga burmeisteri</i>, the Chu&ntilde;ia of Tucuman and Catamarca in Argentina,
  is smaller and darker, with shorter legs and little crest; it has a broad white superciliary
  streak, and two wide black bars on the tail-feathers, except the median pair. The bill and feet
  are black, the iris is grey.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Both species are chiefly diurnal, the former frequenting the high grass of the open "campos" in
  pairs and parties of five or six, the latter forests or bushy districts; they roost on trees,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page260"><span class="smaller">{260}</span></span>stalk about in stately
  fashion, stoop when running, and fly a little when hard pressed. The barking or screaming cry is
  chiefly heard towards dusk; the food consists of small mammals, snakes, lizards, snails, worms,
  insects and their larvae, as well as berries, <i>Chunga</i> preferring the insect diet. Easily
  domesticated, and in Brazil protected by custom, these birds will guard their owners' fowls; while
  the male at times incubates and shews off to the females in spring, like a Bustard. <i>Cariama</i>
  builds a nest of twigs in low trees or bushes; <i>Chunga</i> generally chooses the ground; but in
  either case the young soon leave their quarters; the two eggs have a pale ground-colour with
  rufous blotches, as in so many Rails. The Seriem&aacute; has been hatched in the Zoological Society's
  Gardens in London.</p>

  <p>The fossil <i>Phororhachos</i> and certain others of the so-called Stereornithes (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page44">44</a></span>) probably belong here.</p>

  <p>Fam. VI. <b>Otididae.</b>&ndash;The Bustards are here admitted as a Family of the Gruiformes,
  though many writers have preferred to refer them to the Limicolae, and the question is by no means
  finally settled. The head is flat, the neck thick, the bill somewhat blunt and depressed, being
  either short, as in <i>Otis</i> and <i>Trachelotis</i>, or longer, as in <i>Neotis</i> and
  <i>Lissotis</i>. The metatarsus varies much, the length for instance being comparatively great in
  <i>Houbaropsis</i>, and small in <i>Otis tetrax</i>, while both surfaces are covered with
  reticulated scales; the short, stout toes have flattish nails, and the hallux is absent, as in
  many Limicoline forms. The wings are moderate, with the secondaries almost equal to the primaries,
  the latter&ndash;which are acuminate in <i>Sypheotis</i>&ndash;being eleven in number, and the
  former about twenty; the tail, of medium length, has a more or less rounded outline, and possesses
  from fourteen to twenty rectrices. Ornamental plumes are characteristic of this group, and take
  the form of decided crests on the crown and nape, or on the latter alone, in all the genera except
  <i>Otis</i>, <i>Neotis</i>, <i>Lissotis</i>, <i>Trachelotis</i>, and <i>Sypheotis</i>; the
  last-named, however, has elongated cheek-feathers with bare shafts and spatulate webs. The plumes
  of the throat and fore-neck are lengthened and shield the breast in <i>Houbaropsis</i> and
  <i>Eupodotis</i>, those of the sides of the neck form a ruff in <i>Houbara</i>; while <i>Otis</i>
  is remarkable for the prolonged ear-coverts, and for the tuft of long bristly feathers on each
  side of the base of the mandible in the male.</p>

  <p>The nostrils are pervious, the tongue is sagittate, the furcula <span class="pagenum"
  id="page261"><span class="smaller">{261}</span></span>is <span class="sans fwb">Y</span>-shaped,
  and often ancylosed with the sternum, the syrinx is tracheo-bronchial. An after-shaft is present,
  and the down, which is uniform in the young only, is in them mottled with black and lighter tints.
  A most remarkable phenomenon, moreover, is the gular pouch, opening under the tongue, found in the
  male of some examples of <i>Otis tarda</i> during the breeding season. This pouch becomes very
  small or vanishes altogether at other times of the year, and seems to be restricted to adult
  birds. Similar, but smaller, processes have been observed in <i>Eupodotis kori</i>, <i>E.
  edwardsi</i> and, it is said, <i>Otis tetrax</i>; while dilatations of the oesophagus have been
  recorded in <i>E. australis</i> and <i>Neotis denhami</i>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Otis tarda</i>, the Great Bustard, which, as a native, only became extinct in Norfolk about
  1838, used to extend from East Lothian to Dorset, but is now merely an occasional visitor to
  Britain. The upper parts are mottled with rufous, buff, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page262"><span class="smaller">{262}</span></span>blackish-brown, the head is blue-grey, with
  long white bristles at the base of the mandible, the lower surface is white, relieved in the male
  by a tawny gorget for a short time during the breeding season. The primaries are black, most of
  the secondaries and wing-coverts white. Some other Bustards seem to have a similar vernal change
  of plumage. The female is smaller and has no bristles. <i>O. tetrax</i>, the Little Bustard, a
  straggler to our shores, is somewhat like the last species in colour, but has the cheeks and
  throat grey, bordered by a white line, and below this comes a broad black collar divided in front
  by a median white band in the nesting time. The female is brown and black, with white breast and
  no collar. The remaining members of the Family vary considerably in pattern of colour, being
  spotted, streaked, or vermiculated above, and being occasionally very dark; the head and the lower
  parts, moreover, are not uncommonly quite black, or the latter may be greyish-blue, as in
  <i>Trachelotis coerulescens</i>. The bill and feet are usually yellow, more seldom greyish or
  dusky. Females and young exhibit a more uniform mixture of brown, black, and buff, while rufous
  bases to the feathers are characteristic of the group.</p>

  <p>Bustards are Old World birds, reaching eastwards to Australia, where <i>Eupodotis australis</i>
  is called the "Native Turkey." <i>E. edwardsi</i> inhabits the plains of India, <i>E. arabs</i>
  extends from Arabia to North Africa, and <i>E. kori</i> from the East to the South of that
  continent. <i>Otis</i> ranges over South and Central Europe, and thence to North Africa,
  inhabiting also Mid-Asia to North-West India, the Yangtze-Kiang River and Japan. <i>Houbara
  undulata</i>, the African Ruffed Bustard, reaches from the Canaries,<a id="NtA_176"
  href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> through the Mediterranean basin to about Armenia; its congener
  <i>H. macqueeni</i>, which strays westward to Britain, being resident in Persia, North India and
  Central Asia. <i>Houbaropsis bengalensis</i> and <i>Sypheotis aurita</i> are the Florican and
  Lesser Florican of India; <i>Lophotis</i>, <i>Compsotis</i>, <i>Heterotetrax</i>, <i>Neotis</i>,
  <i>Lissotis</i>, and <i>Trachelotis</i> inhabit the Ethiopian Region. The members of the Family
  are to some extent migratory, and perhaps the Great Bustard was partly so of old in Britain.</p>

  <p>The members of this Family flock in winter, and occasionally form small parties at other
  seasons, the males being very possibly polygamous, though the fact is hardly proved. Typically
  inland birds, they haunt dry grassy and sandy plains, or cultivated ground <span class="pagenum"
  id="page263"><span class="smaller">{263}</span></span>where the crops are low, yet sometimes they
  choose more bushy flats, or stony tops of elevated ridges. Their flight is prolonged and often
  rapid, though invariably heavy, the neck and legs being outstretched; the Great Bustard rises from
  the ground slowly, the Little Bustard with a rattling noise, but they are frequently loth to leave
  it, crouching to escape detection on the similarly coloured soil. They stalk about rapidly and run
  with ease, being shy, wary, and far-sighted, while they are more easy to approach when they resort
  to water. The quill-feathers are said to be lost after breeding.<a id="NtA_177"
  href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> In spring the pugnacious cocks strut around the hens, swelling
  out their plumage, and inflating the gular pouch when it is present; the head meanwhile is thrown
  backwards, the wings droop, the tail is usually erected and outspread, and booming or crooning
  utterances with leaps diversify the performance. At times the notes are described as scolding,
  drumming, craking, and clucking, or resemble "cok-cok" or "prut-prut." The diet consists chiefly
  of juicy plants, such as young corn and turnips, clover and plantains, but it includes berries and
  seeds, insects and their larvae, molluscs, myriapods, frogs, or even small reptiles and mammals.
  The Gom-Paauw<a id="NtA_178" href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> (<i>Eupodotis kori</i>) is
  so-called from its love of mimosa gum. The eggs, varying from two to four or five in different
  species, are deposited in an excavation in the soil&ndash;sometimes lined with grass&ndash;under
  shelter of a bush, tussock, or growing crop; they are oily-green, olive, drab, red-brown, or
  exceptionally bluish-green, and are generally blotched, clouded, or zoned with purplish or dull
  red. The hen sits very closely. Bustards can be circumvented by riding round them in constantly
  diminishing circles, and they are also captured with Falcons.<a id="NtA_179"
  href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A fossil <i>Otis</i> is recorded from the Miocene of France and Germany.</p>

  <p>Fam. VII. <b>Rhinochetidae.</b>&ndash;This contains only one species, <i>Rhinochetus
  jubatus</i>, the Kagu of New Caledonia, a very old and generalized form, somewhat bigger than an
  ordinary fowl, which was originally referred to the Herons and then to the Cranes, but is
  undoubtedly nearly allied to the latter, and approximates rather closely to <i>Eurypyga</i>.<a

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The head and eyes are large; the neck is strong; the bill is Heron-like, but somewhat flat
  above, with a wide nasal groove. The sternum is weak and narrow, having no posterior notch; the
  furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the legs are moderately long and slender, the
  toes Rail-like, with curved claws; the tibia is half bare, the metatarsus scutellated, with
  smaller scales behind. The wings are moderate, broad, and rounded, though less developed than in
  <i>Eurypyga</i>, the primaries being ten in number, and the secondaries&ndash;of which the inner
  exceed the primaries&ndash;thirteen; the tail is fairly long and ample, with twelve rectrices. The
  aftershaft is large; the nostrils are impervious, contrary to the rule in the Order, being
  severally overhung by a peculiar rolled-up membrane, said to protect them when the beak is thrust
  into the soil; the tongue is lanceolate. Powder-down patches are profusely distributed over the
  whole body, except towards the remiges and rectrices. The plumage is slaty-grey, with indistinct
  dark bars on the wings and tail; but when the former are expanded, rufous and white bands appear,
  varied by black markings; while a long, erectile whitish-grey crest adorns the occiput and nape.
  The bill and feet are orange-red. In adults down covers the whole surface. Possibly the chicks
  remain a <span class="pagenum" id="page265"><span class="smaller">{265}</span></span>considerable
  time in the nest, but this is by no means certain; those of <i>Eurypyga</i> do so, it is true, but
  those of Cranes and Rails do not. Immature specimens are more rufous, with black bars above.</p>

  <p>Though formerly the Kagu was not rare in its native island, it is now restricted to the wilder
  portions, where it is to be met with among the rocks of craggy ravines or near stagnant waters,
  sleeping throughout the day and issuing from its concealment towards evening. It walks quickly,
  yet in a stately manner, often coming to a standstill or crouching, and remaining motionless for a
  long period; but it can also run rapidly with the head and neck outstretched, and the body carried
  after the manner of a Rail. The habits in confinement, however, make it somewhat doubtful whether
  the bird is as nocturnal as is asserted, for in the daytime it is quick and lively in its motions,
  chasing its fellow-captives, dancing round with the tip of its outspread wing or tail held fast in
  its bill, tossing about dry leaves or pieces of paper, spreading out its wings and thrusting its
  beak into the ground, kicking with its legs, and finally tumbling about as if in a fit. The note
  is guttural and rattling, or almost a scream; the food consists of molluscs, worms, and insects,
  sought for among the grass or in crannies, while the bill is often plunged into the soil, and
  worms pulled out, shaken and swallowed. When in quest of food the bird often paws the earth with
  gentle strokes, and snails are usually beaten upon the ground to break the shell. It will bathe in
  captivity, and is said to like wet weather in its native haunts. The nest is unknown, but eggs
  laid at the Zoological Society's Gardens in London are reddish-buff with brown and grey markings,
  and recall those of the Woodcock or Corncrake.<a id="NtA_181"
  href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fam. VIII. <b>Eurypygidae.</b>&ndash;Two species of <i>Eurypyga</i> are comprehended herein,
  namely, <i>E. helias</i> of the countries from Venezuela to Bolivia and Central Brazil, and <i>E.
  major</i> of Central America, Colombia, and Ecuador. These are, like the Kagu, very ancient types,
  but whereas that bird shows some affinity to <i>Scopus</i>, these trend rather towards
  <i>Nycticorax</i>, both being, however, essentially Gruiform. The neck is long and thin, the bill
  rather slender, with grooves on the maxilla and mandible: the whole leg and foot are as in
  <i>Rhinochetus</i>, but shorter, weaker, and reticulated behind; the wings and tail are even more
  ample, while the number of primaries and rectrices are the same, but the secondaries are only
  <span class="pagenum" id="page266"><span class="smaller">{266}</span></span>eleven, and the inner
  feathers comparatively short. The nostrils are pervious, the tongue is lanceolate, the furcula is
  <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the after-shaft is diminutive, and the powder-down patches
  are abundant, though writers differ as to their extent. <i>E. helias</i>&ndash;as Prof. Newton
  says in his excellent account<a id="NtA_182" href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a>&ndash;is not to
  be described in a limited space otherwise than generally; it has a black head, with a white stripe
  above and under each eye, and a white throat: the remaining plumage "being variegated with black,
  brown, chestnut, bay, buff, grey, and white&ndash;so mottled, speckled, and belted either in
  wave-like or zigzag forms, as somewhat to resemble certain moths. The bay colour forms two
  conspicuous patches on each wing, and also an antepenultimate bar on the tail, behind which is a
  subterminal band of black. The irides are red; the bill is greenish-olive; and the legs are pale
  yellow." <i>E. major</i> is larger and more uniform in colour. Both adults and nestlings have
  copious down, that of the latter being lightish brown with lines and spots of darker brown and
  white. The sexes are similar.</p>

  <p>The "Sun-Bittern," to use its common but misleading name, is found on the larger rivers, where
  the banks are wooded and swampy; it is shy but easily tamed, and, according to Bates, is kept in
  captivity by the Brazilians. It walks quietly and circumspectly with horizontal body and
  outstretched head, and probably flies but little. Like the Kagu, it executes a fantastic dance,
  but in this case the wings and tail form a semicircle which nearly conceals the body. The note is
  a soft or plaintive long-drawn <span class="pagenum" id="page267"><span
  class="smaller">{267}</span></span>whistle, the food consists mainly of small fish and insects,
  which the bird spears by darting out its head quickly. The nest, said to be made of sticks, grass,
  and mud, with a lining of the latter, is placed on low branches, and contains several eggs similar
  to those of the Kagu, but smaller. Both parents incubate and attend to the young, which have
  several times been reared in the Zoological Society's Gardens in London.<a id="NtA_183"
  href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fam. IX. <b>Heliornithidae.</b>&ndash;The Finfoots, comprising three genera and four species,
  now generally coupled with the Rallidae, have been placed near the Divers and Grebes by several
  authors. The head is small, the neck thin, the bill Rail-like and fairly stout; the metatarsus,
  which is scutellated anteriorly and reticulated posteriorly, is short, twisted outwards, and
  deeply grooved; while the toes have short, sharp claws, and broad scalloped webs, extending in
  <i>Heliornis</i> to most of their length. The long pointed wings have twenty-one remiges, of which
  eleven are primaries, and are armed with a curved spine; the tail consists in <i>Podica</i> of
  eighteen elongated, stiff, ribbed rectrices, which are narrow and pointed, and in <i>Heliopa&iuml;s</i>
  and <i>Heliornis</i> of rather soft, short, rounded feathers. The plumage is close, but not glossy
  as in Grebes; there is no after-shaft, the <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped furcula
  ancyloses with the sternum, the tongue is lanceolate, and the nostrils are pervious.</p>

  <p class="sp3">These birds, which frequent the swamps or rocky streams of inland woods, are very
  shy; their flight is heavy, and they rise with difficulty from the surface of the water, aiding
  themselves by their feet. They swim and dive well, and will remain half-submerged for hours, or
  will sit upon a low branch over a stream, dropping down and scrambling up the bank when disturbed,
  or hiding at its base. They are said, moreover, to run swiftly on land. The note of <i>Heliornis
  fulica</i> is like a dog's bark; the food is in all cases of small fish, crustaceans, insects, and
  seeds. The nest and eggs are unknown, but in the species just mentioned the nestlings are stated
  to be naked. This form, about thirteen inches long, which ranges from Guatemala to Paraguay, is
  olive-brown above, the black head and nape being separated by a white band down each side of the
  neck from a blackish line which encloses the white throat; the chest is buff, the sides are brown,
  the remaining underparts whitish; the bill is red, the feet are yellow, banded with black.
  <i>Podica senegalensis</i> of West Africa, and the doubtfully distinct <span class="pagenum"

  Congo to South East Africa, are larger forms, with round ochreous spots above, and red feet.
  <i>Heliopa&iuml;s personata</i>, extending from Assam to Sumatra, has a black throat, orange bill, and
  light green feet.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order XI. CHARADRIIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The Charadriiformes are here taken to consist of five Sub-Orders. Of these the <span
  class="sc">Limicolae</span> contains the Families <i>Charadriidae</i> (Plovers, Sandpipers,
  Snipes, and so forth), <i>Chionididae</i> (Sheath-bills), <i>Glareolidae</i> (Pratincoles,
  Coursers, and Crab-Plover), <i>Thinocorythidae</i> (Seed-Snipes), <i>Oedicnemidae</i>
  (Stone-Curlews), and <i>Parridae</i> (Ja&ccedil;anas); the <span class="sc">Lari</span> possesses one
  Family, <i>Laridae</i> (Gulls, Terns, and Skuas); the <span class="sc">Alcae</span> only the
  <i>Alcidae</i> (Auks); the <span class="sc">Pterocles</span>, the <i>Pteroclidae</i>
  (Sand-Grouse); but the <span class="sc">Columbae</span> may be divided into <i>Dididae</i>,
  <i>Didunculidae</i>, and <i>Columbidae</i>. The first three may again be combined into a
  Laro-Limicoline group, and the last two into a Pteroclo-Columbine, in accordance with their
  affinities.</p>

  <p>In structure the <span class="sc">Limicolae</span> are sufficiently uniform to be considered
  simultaneously.</p>

  <p>The bill furnishes a useful means of subdividing the <i>Charadriidae</i>. It is hardest in
  <i>Haematopus</i>, <i>Ibidorhynchus</i>, <i>Strepsilas</i>, and so forth, being in them bony
  throughout. In <i>Charadrius</i>, <i>Aegialitis</i>, <i>Lobivanellus</i>, <i>Vanellus</i>, and the
  like, it has a hard tip, but is comparatively flexible towards the base. These may compose
  Sub-family (1) <i>Charadriinae</i>. In <i>Totanus</i>, and its nearest allies, it is still hard at
  the tip, but more flexible at the base. In <i>Tringa</i>, and similar genera, it ceases to be hard
  at the tip, and is slightly endowed with nerves. These may constitute Subfamily (2)
  <i>Tringinae</i>. In <i>Scolopax</i>, <i>Gallinago</i>, and <i>Rhynchaea</i> it becomes highly
  nervous at the tip, and therein differs from that of all other birds. These form Sub-family (3)
  <i>Scolopacinae</i>. In <i>Himantopus</i> and <i>Recurvirostra</i> the bill is so attenuated as
  hardly to be called hard at the tip, but it has no nerves there. The form of the beak varies
  greatly, being asymmetrical and twisted to the right in <i>Anarhynchus</i>, up-curved from the
  middle in <i>Avocetta</i>, wedge-like in <i>Haematopus</i>, much flattened in <i>Tringa
  platyrhyncha</i>, spade-shaped in <i>Eurynorhynchus</i>, arched in <i>Numenius</i>, and strongly
  decurved in <i>Ibidorhynchus</i>. In the Chionididae a horny sheath covers the base of the
  maxilla, and is indicated by faint lines in the young; in <i>Glareola</i> the bill is short,
  curved, and very <span class="pagenum" id="page269"><span
  class="smaller">{269}</span></span>deeply split, making a wide gape; in <i>Dromas</i> it is hard,
  deep, and compressed; in <i>Cursorius</i> thick and little bent; in the Thinocorythidae Fowl-like;
  in the Oedicnemidae short, stout, and blunt; in the Parridae narrow and pointed, with a skinny
  frontal plate, and occasionally with rictal wattles. The nasal grooves are very long in
  <i>Ibidorhynchus</i>, <i>Totanus</i>, <i>Scolopax</i> and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The tibia is often partly bare, and the metatarsus is extremely variable; the legs are longer
  in <i>Himantopus</i> than in any other bird of its size, and long also in <i>Recurvirostra</i>,
  <i>Cursorius</i>, <i>Dromas</i>, the Parridae, and so forth, while <i>Haematopus</i>,
  <i>Aegialitis</i>, <i>Scolopax</i>, <i>Glareola</i>, <i>Chionis</i>, <i>Tringa</i>, and the
  Thinocorythidae are instances of the contrary. Both the front and back of these members are
  scutellated in most Scolopacinae and Tringinae, but the Charadriinae differ considerably in this
  respect; in <i>Glareola</i> the fore-part only is transversely scutellated, in <i>Cursorius</i>,
  <i>Dromas</i>, the Thinocorythidae and Parridae the whole of the surface, while in the Chionididae
  and Oedicnemidae both aspects are reticulated. The anterior toes are ordinarily free, or have the
  third and fourth digits slightly connected; but <i>Dromas</i> and <i>Recurvirostra</i> have them
  partly webbed, as to some extent have <i>Himantopus</i>, <i>Totanus semipalmatus</i>, and a few
  other forms, while in <i>Phalaropus</i> the metatarsus is much compressed, and the toes have lobed
  margins. The hallux, normally set rather high, is frequently aborted, as in <i>Charadrius</i>,
  <i>Ibidorhynchus</i>, <i>Calidris</i>, <i>Cursorius</i> and <i>Oedicnemus</i>; in the
  Thinocorythidae and <i>Glareola</i> it is very small, in <i>Dromas</i> larger; in the Parridae all
  four digits are on a level and abnormally long, as are the claws, so that the birds walk easily on
  floating vegetation. The nail of the mid-toe is pectinated in the Glareolidae, recalling that of
  the Caprimulginae (Night-jars). The digits are often somewhat fleshy, <i>Oedicnemus</i> moreover,
  has an enlarged tibio-tarsal joint.</p>

  <p>The wings are usually long, having a bilobed appearance owing to the equality of the inner
  secondaries and outer primaries; <i>Himantopus</i>, <i>Dromas</i>, <i>Glareola</i>, and the
  Thinocorythidae have them much elongated, <i>Phegornis</i> and some other forms very short, while
  in <i>Vanellus</i> the expanse is most noticeable. In this genus, <i>Lobivanellus</i>,
  <i>Hoplopterus</i>, the Chionididae, and the Parridae, is found a carpal spur, often large and
  sharp; <i>Metopidius</i>, and, apparently, <i>Hydralector</i> have the radius dilated into a
  sub-triangular lamina<a id="NtA_184" href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a>; <span class="pagenum"
  id="page270"><span class="smaller">{270}</span></span><i>Hydrophasianus</i> has peculiar
  filamentous appendages to the first and fourth primaries; <i>Scolopax minor</i> has the three
  exterior of the normal eleven primaries particularly attenuated. The secondaries in the Limicolae
  vary from ten to twenty.</p>

  <p>The rectrices are usually twelve; though <i>Rhynchaea</i> and the Parridae have ten, while
  <i>Scolopax stenura</i> and <i>S. megala</i> possess twenty and twenty-six respectively, the outer
  of which are exceedingly stiff and narrow&ndash;not to give further instances. The tail in
  <i>Glareola</i> is deeply furcate and Swallow-like, in <i>Hydrophasianus</i> it has the four
  median plumes very long and decurved in the breeding season; but it is often quite short, as in
  <i>Scolopax</i>. The form may be slightly forked, as in <i>Chionis</i>; somewhat graduated or
  cuneate, as in the Thinocorythidae, <i>Totanus hypoleucus</i>, and <i>Oedicnemus</i>; rounded, as
  in <i>Cursorius</i>; or almost even, as in <i>Vanellus</i>.</p>

  <p>The tongue is rather long and pointed, being, however, rudimentary in <i>Numenius</i>; the
  nostrils are pervious, except in the Thinocorythidae, Glareolidae, and perhaps <i>Dromas</i>, and
  have at times a leathery operculum in Plovers; the syrinx is tracheo-bronchial, the furcula <span
  class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; <i>Parra</i> has a decidedly muscular gizzard, and the
  Thinocorythidae possess a globular crop. The convoluted trachea of <i>Rhynchaea</i>, the papillae
  on the orbits of <i>Chionis</i>, the caruncles on the face of <i>Machetes</i>, and the loral
  wattles of <i>Lobivanellus</i> are fully described below. The aftershaft is very small in the
  Parridae, rather large elsewhere. In adults the down is sparing; in the young it is short, thick,
  and commonly of a yellowish hue, with brown longitudinal stripes; though it may be grey, as in
  <i>Chionis</i> and <i>Haematopus</i>; mottled with reddish and white, as in Snipes; or with black,
  orange, yellow, and white, as in Phalaropes.</p>

  <p>The plumage is usually plain brown or grey, with an admixture of white, or less commonly
  chestnut; <i>Vanellus</i>, <i>Lobivanellus</i>, and <i>Cursorius chalcopterus</i>, however,
  exhibit metallic hues, and <i>Chionis</i> is white. Red or yellow beaks or feet adorn many forms.
  Crests occur in certain species of <i>Vanellus</i>, <i>Hoplopterus</i>, and <i>Lobivanellus</i>;
  the male of <i>Machetes</i> (Ruff) is most remarkable for its lateral head-tufts and fine
  neck-frill, developed for the breeding season; <i>Numenius tahitiensis</i> has peculiar
  bristly-pointed flank-feathers. In <i>Scolopax</i> the large eyes are set unusually far back in
  the skull. The sexes are generally similar, but in <i>Eudromias</i>,<a id="NtA_185"
  href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> <i>Phalaropus</i>, and <i>Rhynchaea</i> the female is brighter
  than <span class="pagenum" id="page271"><span class="smaller">{271}</span></span>the male, as well
  as larger, the latter fact holding true of a considerable number of the Tringinae and
  Scolopacinae, and of the Parridae, though a special study of the subject is still needful. In
  several species the breeding plumage differs remarkably from that of winter.</p>

  <p>The <i>Limicolae</i> often flock together in the cold season, but are by no means uniform in
  their habits, and divergencies will be noticed under the various genera. They run well, often
  bobbing the head up and down, and fly strongly, wheeling round sharply in the air; while some
  Snipes rise in zigzag fashion. Typically waders, many, if not all of them, can swim on emergency,
  but few habitually do so, like Phalaropes. Exceptionally they perch on trees, or soar. Swamps,
  river-sides, and in winter the sea-coast, are the general haunts; but Coursers, Stone-Curlews and
  "Seed-Snipes" frequent arid or stony localities, <i>Dromas</i> sandy islets or shores,
  <i>Chionis</i> maritime rocks. <i>Vanellus cayennensis</i> and <i>Parra jacana</i> are said to
  indulge in dances, while Lapwings and other species feign to be wounded if their young are in
  danger. The food consists of crustaceans, molluscs, worms, and insects; rarely of small fish or
  eggs of other birds; but not uncommonly of vegetable matter, on which the Thinocorythidae entirely
  subsist. The usual note is shrill, but the "scape, scape" of the Snipe, the melancholy whistle of
  the Curlew, the yelp of the Godwit, the reiterated scream of the Oyster-catcher, and the sweet
  song or trill of Temminck's Stint and of the Green Sandpiper should be noticed among the
  exceptions. Usually four pyriform eggs, varying from brownish or olive-green to stone-colour, with
  double markings of lighter and darker shades, are arranged in a hole scraped in the ground, with
  or without lining, the small ends pointing to the centre. Those of Oyster-catchers and
  Stone-Curlews are more oval, while the Dotterel and some other species lay only three, and
  Stone-Curlews two. The Parridae amass a considerable pile of water-plants, <i>Chionis</i> usually
  breeds in holes among rocks, the Green and the Wood-Sandpiper often use deserted nests of other
  birds. The young run almost from the shell, the Stone-Curlews and <i>Dromas</i>, which lays a
  white egg in sandy burrows, being to some extent exceptions. The male performs most of the duties
  of incubation in <i>Rhynchaea</i>, <i>Phalaropus</i>, and apparently the Dotterel, Bar-tailed
  Godwit, and Purple Sandpiper&ndash;if not elsewhere; while the Ruff is well known to be
  polygamous. Stone-Curlews and <span class="pagenum" id="page272"><span
  class="smaller">{272}</span></span>Woodcocks are certainly somewhat crepuscular, and the drumming
  of the Snipe (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page291">291</a></span>) must be mentioned in
  passing. Nearly all Limicoline birds are migrants, and may frequently be heard overhead at night,
  when on passage. The flesh is generally excellent.</p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Charadriidae.</b>&ndash;Sub-fam. 1. <i>Charadriinae.</i>&ndash;The Dotterel
  (<i>Eudromias morinellus</i>), breeds on the fells and tundras of Northern Europe and Asia, as
  well as on the mountains of Scotland, Transylvania, Styria, and Bohemia&ndash;if not still in the
  English Lake District; in winter it migrates to Palestine and North Africa. The colour is
  ashy-brown, with black crown and nape, towards the latter of which the white superciliary streaks
  run down; the throat is whitish, the fore-neck brown, divided by a white gorget from the
  orange-chestnut lower breast; the abdomen is black, the lateral rectrices are tipped with white.
  The young are more rufous above, and grey and white below. Three olive eggs with brown blotches
  are laid in a depression of the mossy ground, the parents being tamer than most Plovers at the
  nest. <i>E. veredus</i> inhabits Mongolia, wintering in the Sunda Islands, the Moluccas, and
  Australia; <i>E. australis</i> is confined to the last country; <i>E.</i> (<i>Zonibyx</i>)
  <i>modestus</i>, the only four-toed species of the genus, ranges from Tarapac&aacute; and Buenos Aires to
  Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. <i>Charadrius pluvialis</i>, the Golden Plover, breeds
  on the higher British moorlands, and reaches from Northern Europe to the Lena in Asia, overlapping
  about the Yenisei <i>C. fulvus</i>, with grey instead of white axillaries, which extends to Bering
  Sea and&ndash;as the stouter, shorter-toed race <i>C. dominicus</i>&ndash;to Greenland. Both the
  latter have occurred in England. The plumage is black, densely spotted with yellow above, the
  forehead and superciliary streaks are white, as are the sides of the body. In winter the under
  parts are nearly white. At that season the various species migrate southwards as far as Cape
  Colony, India, Australia, New Zealand, Polynesia, and Chili. The loud clear whistle of the Golden
  Plover is a characteristic sound in summer on our sub-alpine hills, where the bird deposits four
  rich olive-brown eggs in a hollow in the herbage; it is very wary at the nest. The Grey Plover,
  <i>Squatarola helvetica</i>, with a distinct hind toe and black axillaries, is browner than the
  foregoing three-toed species in summer, and greyer in winter; it visits us from autumn to spring,
  but breeds in the far north of Eastern Europe, Asia, and America, reaching Cape Colony, Ceylon,
  and Tasmania on migration. <i>Erythrogonys cinctus</i> of Australia, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page273"><span class="smaller">{273}</span></span>the long-billed <i>Oreophilus ruficollis</i>
  of South America from Peru and Argentina to Patagonia and the Falklands, are nearly allied forms;
  while the rufous New Zealand <i>Charadrius</i> (?) <i>obscurus</i> apparently somewhat resembles
  the Dotterel in its habits and eggs.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Aegialitis hiaticola</i>, the Ringed Plover, Sand-Lark, or Stone-runner, mistakenly called
  the "Ring Dotterel," which is common on the British coasts and even inland, extends from Smith's
  Sound eastwards to Bering Strait, and migrates to South Africa, North India, or accidentally,
  Australia. It breeds as far south as the Atlantic Islands, North Africa, and Turkestan. The
  plumage is light brown, with white forehead, post-ocular streak, upper neck, alar bar, outer
  rectrices, and under surface; the crown, lores, cheeks, and a collar&ndash;broader in
  front&ndash;being black. The young lack the black crown. The habits and "peeping" cry hardly
  require description. When nesting on the warrens of the Eastern Counties it is called the
  Stone-hatch, because it there lays its black-spotted drab eggs in a hole paved with small stones.
  <i>Ae. curonica</i>, the Little Ringed Plover, which strays to Britain, the F&auml;roes, and Iceland,
  breeds on inland waters from Scandinavia to Japan; reaching southwards to North Africa, Turkestan,
  and China, and on migration to the Gaboon, Mozambique, Ceylon, and New Guinea. It is distinguished
  from the last species by the shafts of all the primaries, except the outer one, being dusky.
  <i>Ae. cantiana</i>, the Kentish Plover, which still nests in Kent and Sussex, occupies
  Europe&ndash;though very locally&ndash;North Africa, and Central Asia to China and Japan; it
  comparatively seldom breeds inland, and is found in winter as far as South Africa, India, and
  Australia. The collar is incomplete in front, the female has no black crown, while the black legs
  distinguish it from <span class="pagenum" id="page274"><span
  class="smaller">{274}</span></span>the Ringed Plover. <i>Ae. semipalmata</i>, with a distinct web
  between the outer and middle toes, replaces the latter in North America, ranging in winter to Peru
  and Brazil; whereas <i>Ae. placida</i> represents it in China, Japan, and India. The place of the
  Kentish Plover is taken in western North America by <i>Ae. nivosa</i>&ndash;with white lores
  instead of black&ndash;which migrates to Chili. <i>Ae. vocifera</i>, termed "Kill-deer" from its
  cry, inhabits North America, and extends in winter to northern South America, while it has been
  shot even in the Scilly Islands; the lores are brown, and the fore-neck exhibits two black bands.
  It nests in the interior on grass or ploughed fields. In <i>Ae. monachus</i> of Southern
  Australia, the breeding male has a perfectly black head; in <i>Ae. asiatica</i> of Central Asia,
  which has wandered to Britain, the head is brown, and the breast shews a black-edged chestnut
  band, somewhat similar to that in <i>Ae. bicincta</i> of the Australian Region, and other species;
  <i>Ae. bifrontata</i> of Madagascar has grey lores, and two black bands on the breast. Space fails
  to mention all the species of this large three-toed genus; but <i>Ae.</i> (<i>Thinornis</i>)
  <i>novae zealandiae</i> of the New Zealand area, <i>Ae. falklandica</i> of America from Chili and
  Argentina southwards, and <i>Ae. sanctae helenae</i>, the "Wire-bird" peculiar to St. Helena,
  should be noticed.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Anarhynchus frontalis</i>, the Wry-bill of New Zealand, is grey, with a black gorget and
  whitish lower parts; the habits are as in <i>Aegialitis</i>, but the laterally-twisted bill
  enables the bird to pick up insects from around stones with the greatest ease.</p>

  <p>Thirteen species may perhaps be included in <i>Lobivanellus</i> (Wattled Lapwing); but here, as
  in the next genus, <i>Vanellus</i>, there are many diversities of opinion. The two groups are
  fairly similar in habits, nests, and eggs. Some have a hallux, some not. <i>L. pectoralis</i> of
  Australia and Tasmania, <i>L. indicus</i>, ranging from Arabia and Mesopotamia to Cochin China,
  <i>L. cinereus</i> of China and Japan, which migrates as far as Bengal, <i>L. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page275"><span class="smaller">{275}</span></span>melanocephalus</i> of
  North-East Africa, <i>L. superciliosus</i>, extending from West Africa to Lake Tanganyika, and the
  crested <i>L.</i> (<i>Sarciophorus</i>) <i>tectus</i>, found from Senegal to East Equatorial
  Africa and Arabia, have small loral wattles; <i>L.</i> (<i>Lobipluvia</i>) <i>malabaricus</i> of
  India, Ceylon, and Burma, <i>L. miles</i>, reaching from Timor Laut to New Guinea and Australia,
  <i>L. cucullatus</i> of Sumatra, Java, and Timor, <i>L. lobatus</i> of Australia, accidental in
  New Zealand, <i>L. lateralis</i> of the southern, and <i>L. senegalensis</i> of the northern
  Ethiopian Region, with <i>L. albiceps</i> of West Africa and the Upper Congo, have large wattles,
  and, except the first, a wing-spur. <i>L. lobatus</i> is olive-brown above, with black crown,
  nape, and wings; the cheeks, tail-coverts, and lower parts are white; the tail is white with black
  tip; the bill, wattles, and spurs are yellow, the feet purplish-red.</p>

  <p><i>Vanellus</i> comprises the true Lapwings; it is a closely allied genus to the last, and
  varies as to the possession of a hind-toe. <i>V. cristatus</i>, the English Peewit or Green
  Plover, has the upper parts and motile crest bottle-green, with a purple and copper gloss; the
  throat and upper breast black; the cheeks, sides of the neck, base of tail, and under surface
  white; the upper and lower tail-coverts bay. The slow flapping flight and shrill cry are as
  familiar to us as are the cock's aerial evolutions, and the habit of tumbling on the ground with
  an apparently broken wing to decoy intruders from the brood. This species frequents alike
  cultivated ground, marshes, and wastes, depositing its four olive eggs with black markings in a
  scraping in the soil lined with a little dry herbage; towards autumn it feeds in large flocks upon
  the shore, being semi-crepuscular, as might be expected from the large eyes. Breeding in most of
  Europe, Northern Asia, and even North Africa, it strays to Greenland and Jan Mayen, occurs
  plentifully in Japan, and at times in Alaska, and migrates as far south as Barbados, North India,
  and China. The somewhat similar T&eacute;ru-t&eacute;ru (<i>V. cayennensis</i>),<a id="NtA_186"
  href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> with long crest and large blunt yellow spur, occupies the
  east, and the larger <i>V. chilensis</i> the west and south of South America; <i>V.
  resplendens</i> inhabits the Andes of North Chili, Peru, and Ecuador; <i>V. coronatus</i> South
  and East Africa; <i>V. melanopterus</i>, the latter and Arabia; <i>V. inornatus</i> West and
  South-East Africa. The long legged <i>Chettusia gregaria</i>, which, like the next genus,
  possesses a hallux, has occurred in Britain and South-West Europe, but breeds from South-East
  Europe to Lake Saisan, and migrates to North-East <span class="pagenum" id="page276"><span
  class="smaller">{276}</span></span>Africa, India, and Ceylon. <i>C. leucura</i>, of similar range,
  winters in North-East Africa and North India. <i>Defilippia crassirostris</i> of North-East, and
  <i>D. leucoptera</i> of South-East Africa, with very long toes and much white on the wing, are
  nearly akin to the above. <i>Hoplopterus spinosus</i>, the three-toed Spur-winged Lapwing of Egypt
  and the northern Ethiopian Region, which wanders to South-East Europe and Persia, is a crested
  black and white species with a brownish back. The Arabs call it "Zic-zac" from its cry, while it
  attacks birds on the wing with its spur. <i>H. speciosus</i> occupies South Africa, <i>H.
  cayanus</i> most of South America, <i>H. ventralis</i> ranges from North and Central India to
  Hainan.</p>

  <p><i>Strepsilas interpres</i>, the Turnstone, has the head, rump, tail, and remiges black and
  white, the upper parts varied with chestnut and black, the breast black, the belly white, and the
  feet orange, with the hind toe turned inwards. In winter the coloration is chiefly grey and white.
  From its extensive migrations, it is possibly the most cosmopolitan of Birds, while it breeds in
  Northern Europe, Asia, and America, and as near us as Denmark, though not proved to do so in
  Britain. In autumn and spring this lively little species frequents our muddy shores or
  seaweed-covered rocks, often turning over the pebbles in search of food; the note is a twitter or
  whistle; the nest a slightly-lined excavation under shelter of some maritime shrub or stone,
  containing four grey-green eggs, marked with olive-brown. <i>S. melanocephalus</i>, of the Pacific
  coast of North America, lacks chestnut tints. <i>Aphriza virgata</i>, the Surf-bird, a brownish
  species with white alar bar, rump, and abdomen, found from Alaska to Chili, may perhaps be placed
  here. The position of the scarce Patagonian <i>Pluvianellus sociabilis</i>, which is chiefly grey
  above and white below, is equally doubtful. Both species lack the hallux. <i>Haematopus
  ostralegus</i>, the Oyster-catcher, inhabits Europe and Central Asia, extending&ndash;as the form
  <i>H. osculans</i>&ndash;to China and Japan; in winter it reaches Senegambia, Mozambique, Ceylon,
  and South China. From the black head, neck, and mantle, white lower back, underparts, wing-bar,
  and base of tail, it is called the Sea-Pie; while a habit of opening mussels with the long
  wedge-shaped bill gives it the name of Mussel-picker. Oyster-catcher seems a misnomer, but worms,
  crustaceans, and so forth vary the diet. It frequents shores and inland rivers, depositing three,
  or rarely four, oval drab eggs, with blackish and grey markings, on sand, shingle, or rocks. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page277"><span class="smaller">{277}</span></span>The scream in the breeding
  season is often quite deafening, but at other times these wary birds are seldom noisy. Their
  flight is powerful, and they can swim and dive. The bill is orange and the feet flesh-coloured in
  this species, as well as in <i>H. longirostris</i> of the Moluccas, Papuasia, Australia, and New
  Zealand, with longer bill and entirely black primaries. <i>H. leucopus</i> of Chili, Patagonia,
  and the Falklands, has a black lower back and pale feet; <i>H. palliatus</i> (with its races
  <i>frazari</i>, <i>galapagensis</i>, and <i>durnfordi</i>), ranging from Nova Scotia and
  California to Patagonia, has a brown mantle. Of the perfectly black or brownish-black species,
  <i>H. niger</i>, of both coasts of the North Pacific, has pale flesh-coloured feet; <i>H.
  moquini</i>, of the Ethiopian Region, the Canaries, and Madeira, has them deep red; <i>H.
  ater</i>, found from Peru to Patagonia and the Falklands, has the scarlet bill compressed and
  upturned; <i>H. unicolor</i> of Australia and New Zealand has the feet brick-red. This genus has
  three toes, as has the remarkable <i>Ibidorhynchus struthersi</i>, with long decurved red bill and
  greenish-grey feet, found from Turkestan to China, and in the Himalayas. The front of the head is
  black, margined laterally with white; the upper parts and neck are grey, with white on the wings
  and outer rectrices, and black undulations on the tail, which has the tip and coverts mostly
  black; the under parts are white with a black gorget. The bill is black in the young. The note is
  whistling, the habits are like those of an Oyster-catcher, while islands in stony or sandy rivers
  furnish breeding sites.<a id="NtA_187" href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Himantopus</i> contains the extraordinarily long-legged Stilts, of which <i>H. candidus</i>
  visits Britain and Northern Europe, but breeds only in the southern parts, including Hungary. It
  also nests in India and Ceylon, and in Africa&ndash;though chiefly in the north. In the cold
  season it reaches Timor, New Zealand, and elsewhere. The head, long neck, lower back, and under
  surface are white, the remaining parts greenish-black; the iris is carmine, the legs are pink.
  Females are browner above, while immature males have the crown and nape black or brownish. The
  note is clear and reiterated, the habits are Plover-like, but the nest, placed on mud or in
  grass-tufts, is more substantial than in those birds, and contains four olive eggs with black
  scrawls or blotches. Whether searching the shallows for insects or other food, hovering overhead
  with dangling feet, or flying with them outstretched, the appearance is equally remarkable. <i>H.
  mexicanus</i> of temperate <span class="pagenum" id="page278"><span
  class="smaller">{278}</span></span>North America, migrating to Peru and Brazil, has a black
  occiput and nape; <i>H. knudseni</i> of the Sandwich Islands has the sides of the neck also black;
  <i>H. brasiliensis</i> of southern South America has the nape only black, with a white collar
  below; <i>H. leucocephalus</i> of Australia and New Zealand, which visits the Malay Islands, the
  Philippines, the Moluccas and Papuasia, is similar, but the black does not reach the eye; <i>H.
  melas</i> of New Zealand is uniform black. <i>H.</i> (<i>Cladorhynchus</i>) <i>pectoralis</i> of
  Southern Australia has webbed feet like the four-toed Avocets, though itself three-toed like other
  Stilts, from which a bay pectoral band distinguishes it. Of the Avocets with their curious
  up-curved beak, <i>Recurvirostra andina</i>, of the Chilian Andes, alone resembles the Stilts in
  possessing a black mantle. <i>R. avocetta</i>, which bred in England until at least 1824, now
  ranges from Denmark and Holland to Mongolia and South Africa, though decidedly local; in Asia it
  migrates southwards to Ceylon and Hainan. The plumage is white, with the crown, nape, inner
  scapulars, and part of the wings black, the legs light blue. It is called Cobbler's Awl, from its
  long, flexible bill, or Yelper, from its loud clear cry. Its general habits and slight nest recall
  those of Plovers, though the eggs are larger; while it seeks for aquatic creatures, in shallows or
  pools left by the tide, with a curious scooping sidelong action of the beak. <i>R. americana</i>,
  with a pale rufous head and neck, inhabits temperate America, extending in winter to the West
  Indies and Guatemala: <i>A. rubricollis</i> (<i>novae hollandiae</i>), with those portions
  chestnut, ranges from Australia, where it breeds, to New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2.&ndash;The <i>Tringinae</i> of the present work&ndash;four-toed unless otherwise
  stated&ndash;are often separated into the groups <i>Phalaropodinae</i>, <i>Totaninae</i>, and
  <i>Tringinae</i> proper; the first being remarkable for the Coot-like digits with lobed webs.
  <i>Phalaropus fulicarius</i>, the Grey Phalarope, which visits us in winter, and has even reached
  Chili and New Zealand, breeds in Spitsbergen, Iceland, Greenland, Arctic America, and Asia. It is
  blackish and chestnut above and rufous below, with a little white on the face, wings, and tail;
  but the plumage differs remarkably in winter, the upper parts becoming grey with a black nuchal
  patch, and the lower white. As in all the genus, the female is said to court the male, which is
  duller, and performs most of the duties of incubation. The eggs are larger and rounder than in the
  next species, the nest less concealed. <i>P.</i> (<i>Lobipes</i>) <i>hyperboreus</i>, the
  Red-necked Phalarope, <span class="pagenum" id="page279"><span
  class="smaller">{279}</span></span>with more tapering bill, breeds in Scandinavia, Russia, and
  Siberia, as well as from Alaska to Greenland, Iceland, Shetland, Orkney, and the Hebrides; it
  rarely migrates to Western Europe, but reaches India, New Guinea, Guatemala, and Peru. It has dark
  grey and rufous upper parts, a white alar bar, throat, and belly, a grey breast, and chestnut
  sides of the neck nearly meeting in front. By winter the red tints have vanished and the white has
  increased. This attractive little bird is often so tame that it will feed at the feet of an
  intruder, or will even proceed to settle itself on its small and rather deep nest, placed in some
  tuft of herbage; the four eggs are greenish-olive with black markings. When disturbed from them it
  flies around with a shrill reiterated "tweet." It breeds in swamps or by hill-lakes, and can swim
  well, but is not found so far out to sea as the Grey Phalarope. <i>P.</i> (<i>Steganopus</i>)
  <i>wilsoni</i>, of temperate North America, migrating as far as Patagonia and the Falklands, is a
  larger, longer-billed bird, with a white nape and a black stripe down each side of the head and
  neck.</p>

  <p><i>Tringa alpina</i>, the Dunlin or Oxbird, is familiar to most autumn visitors to our flatter
  coasts. Breeding not uncommonly in Britain, though chiefly in the north, it is found in the colder
  parts of both the Old and the New World, while exceptionally its eggs have been obtained in
  Southern Spain; in winter it extends to the Canaries, Zanzibar, India, China, California, and the
  West Indies. When first they arrive on the shore the large flocks are remarkably tame, and allow
  even gunners to walk among them, as they forage with head bent down over the mud or sand, or rise
  with a cheeping cry, only to alight again at close quarters. The slight nest, placed amongst
  heather or short grass on some moory hill-pasture or seaside marsh, contains four greenish-white
  eggs with brown or rufous spotting. The plumage exhibits a mixture of rufous, grey, and black
  above, and is chiefly white beneath, with a large, black, pectoral patch; the decurved bill and
  the feet are black. Most of the rufous and all the black disappear in winter. <i>T. minuta</i>,
  the Little Stint, a miniature Dunlin with no black on the breast, and a short, straight bill,
  visits Britain regularly on passage, and breeds from the coasts of Northern Norway and Russia to
  Arctic Asia, a red-throated species or race (<i>T. ruficollis</i>) occurring east of the Lena; in
  winter the birds reach South Africa, the Indian Region, Australia, and Tasmania. <i>T.
  minutilla</i>, the darker American Stint, with olive feet, which occupies the Arctic New <span
  class="pagenum" id="page280"><span class="smaller">{280}</span></span>World, has been obtained in
  England, and migrates at least as far as Ecuador and Brazil; the very similar Eastern Asiatic
  <i>T. subminuta</i> reaches Bering Island, and winters southwards to the Indian Region and
  Australia. The habits and eggs of the Little Stint resemble those of the Dunlin, but the latter
  are smaller; the note, too, is more like the twitter of a swallow. <i>T. temmincki</i> is
  greyish-brown above and more buff below, with dark markings throughout, white belly, alar bar and
  four outer rectrices. In winter the dusky markings vanish, and the birds resemble miniature Common
  Sandpipers. They frequently visit Britain, and breed in Northern Europe and Asia, chiefly beyond
  the limits of forest growth; migrating southwards to Senegambia, North-East Africa, India, the
  Malay countries, and China. Temminck's Stint has a hovering, butterfly-like flight, and habitually
  perches on posts and the like, uttering a continuous trilling note or song; the four buff or
  greyish-green eggs with their brown spotting are deposited on a little herbage among sedge or
  grass. <i>T. subarquata</i>, the Curlew-Sandpiper, is grey, black, and rufous, with chestnut under
  surface and black bars on the white rump, both these parts becoming white in winter; the bill is
  long and decurved. As far as is yet known, the breeding-quarters lie in the far north of Asia,
  eggs having recently (1897) been taken near the mouth of the Yenesei: but the bird occurs in
  Arctic Europe in spring and autumn, and visits our shores irregularly in company with other small
  waders in autumn, wandering occasionally to Eastern America and Alaska, and migrating to Cape
  Colony, India, and Tasmania. <i>T. fuscicollis</i>, Bonaparte's Sandpiper, with white upper
  tail-coverts, but dusky rump and short bill, inhabits Arctic America, reaching the whole of South
  America in winter, and even straying to Britain. It has also occurred in Franz Josef Land in
  summer. It somewhat resembles the Dunlin in appearance, and the Purple Sandpiper in habits. The
  closely allied <i>T. bairdi</i> of nearly all America, which breeds towards the North, is
  distinguished by the median tail-coverts being brownish; it has once been observed in South
  Africa. Another dark-rumped species is <i>T. maculata</i>, the Pectoral Sandpiper, blackish-brown
  and rufous above, and buff with dusky streaks beneath, the belly being white. It has occurred
  several times in Britain, but inhabits the "Barren Grounds" from Alaska to Hudson's Bay, and
  migrates as far as Patagonia. Four greenish-buff eggs with brown blotches are deposited in dry
  grassy spots. <span class="pagenum" id="page281"><span class="smaller">{281}</span></span>The male
  is especially remarkable for his habit, apparently unique in the Family, of inflating the
  oesophagus during his courting performances, until it hangs down like a bag; meanwhile he takes
  short flights or rises with stiffened wings in the air, uttering a muffled booming note.<a
  id="NtA_188" href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> The Old World form, <i>T. acuminata</i>, extends
  from East Siberia to Alaska, migrating to the Malay Archipelago, New Guinea, Australia, and New
  Zealand; it differs in its white chin and distinctly streaked flanks. <i>T. maritima</i> or
  <i>striata</i>, the Purple Sandpiper, is brownish-grey above, with rufous spotting on the blacker
  mantle, and some white on the wing; the throat and breast are greyish with dusky streaks, the
  abdomen is white. In winter, when the upper parts are purplish-black and the breast is unspotted,
  it occurs from Scandinavia and temperate America to the Mediterranean and the Bermudas, arriving
  in Britain later than its congeners, and frequenting spray-washed, seaweed-covered rocks in search
  of small molluscs. It is usually tame, can swim well, and utters a soft low note. The eggs, often
  of a very green ground-colour, are deposited in mossy or grassy places on hill-tops, from the
  F&auml;roes northwards, though in the more Arctic regions of Europe and Eastern America the bird breeds
  at the sea-level. It nests in Franz Josef Land, but is rare in Asia. The Prybilof Island form has
  been called <i>T. ptilocnemis</i>, the Alaskan <i>T. couesi</i>. <i>T. canutus</i>, the Knot,
  possibly, but not probably, named after Canute, has in summer a reddish head and neck, black,
  cinnamon, and white upper parts, chestnut under surface, and white tail-coverts barred with black.
  The plumage varies greatly according to age and season, but the winter adult is grey above and
  white with dusky flecks below. While no absolutely identified eggs exist, this species undoubtedly
  breeds on the North Georgian or Parry Islands, Melville Peninsula, Grinnell Land, Smith's Sound,
  and Lady Franklin Bay, but apparently not in Arctic Europe, though possibly in Asia. Large flocks
  migrate to our shores, and some individuals reach Brazil, Damara-Land, the Indian Region,
  Australia, and New Zealand; they are tame on arrival and used to be netted for the table in
  England. In Arctic America <i>Saxifraga oppositifolia</i> and <i>Algae</i> vary the diet of
  insects and molluscs, but other Sandpipers are known to eat plants. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page282"><span class="smaller">{282}</span></span>The East Siberian <i>T. crassirostris</i>,
  with no chestnut beneath, migrates to Japan, the Indian Region, and Australia.</p>

  <p><i>Ereunetes pusillus</i>, called the Semipalmated Sandpiper from its partly webbed toes,
  resembles the western form of the Little Stint in coloration; it breeds in the extreme north of
  America, and has reached Patagonia in winter. <i>Eurynorhynchus pygmaeus</i>, the Spoon-billed
  Sandpiper, on the other hand, is coloured like the eastern red-throated Little Stint, but is
  especially remarkable for its large, broad, shovel-shaped bill. The breeding grounds are not
  known, but it has been obtained on both sides of the North Pacific, and on migration in Japan,
  China, India, and Burma. <i>Calidris arenaria</i>, the Sanderling, easily recognisable by the want
  of a hind-toe, is rufous and black above, and white below, having a chestnut throat spotted with
  black. It reaches us in August, while some individuals remain throughout the winter, being at that
  season uniform grey with white under surface. The eggs, which have a peculiar greenish tint, and
  are like those of the Curlew in miniature, have been taken in Greenland and Arctic America, but,
  except perhaps in Iceland, never yet in Northern Europe or Asia. Sanderlings are almost as
  cosmopolitan as Turnstones, and on migration are commonly observed running at the edge of the
  surf, uttering a weak, shrill cry. <i>Limicola platyrhyncha</i>, the Broad-billed Sandpiper, has a
  wide flat beak with the pointed tip slightly decurved; the upper plumage is mottled with dark
  brown, rufous, and white; the breast is reddish-white, spotted with brown; the abdomen white. It
  occasionally visits Britain, and breeds on the fells of Norway, the fens of Lapland, and thence
  eastwards to Russia, but is rarely met with in Asia until the Sea of Okhotsk is reached; in
  winter, when it becomes grey above and white below, it resorts to North Africa, Madagascar,
  Ceylon, the Philippines, the Moluccas, and China. It soars like a Snipe, utters a rapid, double
  note, and is somewhat skulking. The parent sits very closely on the eggs, in which the greenish or
  buff ground-colour is commonly nearly hidden by chocolate or rufous markings. <i>Tryngites
  rufescens</i>, the Buff-breasted Sandpiper, which has wandered to Britain and Heligoland, breeds
  in the extreme north of America, and just reaches East Siberia; in winter it ranges to Peru and
  Argentina. Light brown and black above, and reddish-buff with a few black spots below, the
  distinctive black marblings beneath the quills are well seen as the bird, according to its habit,
  runs along with one wing raised.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page283"><span class="smaller">{283}</span></span></div>

  <p>Here may be mentioned <i>Aechmorhynchus cancellatus</i> (<i>parvirostris</i>), of Christmas and
  Paumotu Islands in the Pacific, which is rufous-brown with white under surface mostly barred with
  brown; and <i>Prosobonia leucoptera</i>, Latham's White-winged Sandpiper, from Tahiti and Eimeo,
  with brown head and mantle, chestnut rump and lower parts, white wing-patch and superciliary
  streak&ndash;species of doubtful affinity, which are both presumably extinct.</p>

  <p>The large genus <i>Totanus</i> is more inland in its haunts during the breeding season than
  <i>Tringa</i>. <i>T. calidris</i>, the Redshank, is resident in Britain, and ranges through
  Europe, the Mediterranean, and Asia south of lat. 60&deg; N., migrating to South Africa, the Indian
  Region, and Japan. The upper parts are light brown with darker bars and streaks, the primaries
  being black; the rump, secondaries, tail, and lower surface are white, but the two latter are
  barred with blackish and flecked with brown respectively; the feet are orange-red, or yellowish in
  the young. In winter the colour is ashy-grey, with nearly white under parts. This bird breeds in
  salt marshes or swamps, not uncommonly far inland, and deposits four buff eggs with reddish or
  purplish-brown spots in grass or rush-tufts, making little or no nest, but drawing the herbage
  together over the spot to conceal it. Both parents usually rise a long way ahead of the intruder,
  and fly wildly round, uttering their shrill whistling cry of "pitotoi." Redshanks are especially
  wary on the coast in winter, and, like Curlews or Lapwings, are the bane of the shooter; they can
  swim and dive, and not uncommonly perch on trees; the food, procured on sandy spots or
  sea-weed-covered rocks, consists of molluscs, crustaceans, worms, and aquatic insects. <i>T.
  fuscus</i>, the Dusky or Spotted Redshank, a scarce visitor to our shores, breeds in Europe and
  Asia, chiefly north of the Arctic Circle, and has a similar winter range to its congener. It
  generally nests in forest-clearings some way from water, and lays fine greenish eggs, blotched
  with varied browns. The female sits very closely. Less noisy than its kindred, unless accompanied
  by young, it flies comparatively strongly, perches on trees, and recalls the Greenshank by its
  habits. The plumage is black, with white spots above, white rump and barred tail; in winter it
  resembles that of the Redshank, and the crimson legs become orange-red. <i>T. flavipes</i>, the
  Yellowshank, which has wandered to England, inhabits the colder parts of North America, and
  migrates as far as Patagonia; it is black, grey-brown, and white above, and white with dusky <span
  class="pagenum" id="page284"><span class="smaller">{284}</span></span>markings below, the legs
  being bright yellow. <i>T. melanoleucus</i>, of the same districts, is similar, but larger. <i>T.
  guttifer</i> is a rare North Pacific species, recorded in winter from Calcutta and Burma. It is
  not unlike <i>T. glottis</i>, the Greenshank, which ranges over Northern Europe and Asia, and
  extends in winter to Cape Colony, the Indian Region, and Australia. This bird has wandered to
  America, and breeds in the hill-districts of Scotland, resembling the Dusky Redshank in its
  selection of dry nesting sites, habit of perching, and so forth. It is, however, much more noisy,
  uttering a strident note, or one dimly recalling a Woodpecker, while it lays large, buffish-white
  eggs with rich brown blotches. It sometimes eats small fish, as does its congener <i>T.
  incanus</i>. The plumage is grey and black above in summer and grey in winter, with white rump and
  tail, the latter being barred with dusky; the white breast is spotted with brown in the breeding
  season; the slightly up-turned beak is blackish; the legs are olive. <i>T. stagnatilis</i>, the
  Marsh Sandpiper, a miniature Greenshank of somewhat similar winter range, occupies South Europe
  and Central Asia. <i>T. glareola</i>, the Wood Sandpiper, is olive-brown above, with small whitish
  spots and white rump; the white cheeks, fore-neck, and breast are heavily streaked with brown; the
  tail-feathers and axillaries are also white with black bars and brown flecks respectively, the
  feet are olive. The nest has once at least been found in Britain, whence the bird ranges over
  North Europe and Asia; it has apparently bred in Spain and Italy, and migrates to Cape Colony, the
  Indian Region, and Australia. In this species and the following the note is shrill and often
  tremulous, while the former occasionally, and the latter habitually, lays its greenish eggs with
  reddish-brown spots in deserted nests of other birds near inland waters, instead of on the ground.
  <i>T. ochropus</i>, the Green Sandpiper, which is less spotted above, has much wider black
  tail-bars, and blackish axillaries with white chevrons. It has been suspected of breeding in
  Britain, and occupies a similar though somewhat more northern range than the last-named, but does
  not reach Australia. <i>T. solitarius</i>, with almost uniform brown median rectrices, inhabits
  temperate, and migrates to tropical, South America; it has been shot in the littoral marshes of
  western England. <i>T.</i> (<i>Symphemia</i>) <i>semipalmatus</i>, largest of the genus, the
  Willet of temperate North America, which extends to Brazil in winter and wanders to Europe, is
  brownish-grey with black mottlings, the outspread <span class="pagenum" id="page285"><span
  class="smaller">{285}</span></span>wing shewing a white patch, and the white under parts brownish
  streaks. In the cold season all the dark markings vanish. <i>T.</i> (<i>Heteractitis</i>)
  <i>incanus</i>, having uniform grey upper, and white under surface, closely barred in summer with
  dusky, is found through the Eastern Pacific Islands, and on the mainland from Alaska to the
  Gal&aacute;pagos. <i>T. brevipes</i>, with white-banded upper tail-coverts, occurs from Kamtschatka and
  East Siberia to the Malay Islands and Australia. Both breed to the northward.</p>

  <p><i>Machetes pugnax</i>, the Ruff&ndash;with its consort the Reeve&ndash;was formerly well-known
  in England from the large numbers netted or snared for the table. Our nesting birds are now
  reduced to a few pairs, but considerable numbers visit us on passage, while they breed through
  northern Europe and Asia, and migrate to South Africa, the Indian region, and Japan, wandering
  rarely to Iceland and Eastern America. The Ruff's nuptial plumage, which varies extraordinarily
  and individually, may be chiefly black, white, chestnut, buff, grey and white, and so forth, often
  with metallic hues or concentric barring. A tuft of stiff curled plumes springs from near each
  ear, the feathers of the face are replaced by yellowish or pinkish tubercles, and an ample
  distensible ruff overhangs the breast. Males regain the same colours annually, but after breeding
  become like the females, which are dark brown and buff, and one-third smaller. The polygamous
  tendencies and habit of "hilling," <i>i.e.</i> sparring on some slight eminence for the Reeves,
  have been frequently described;<a id="NtA_189" href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> the note,
  though seldom heard, is said to resemble ka-ka-kuk; the food includes seeds, insects, and worms;
  the nest, placed among herbage in the drier parts of a swamp, contains four greenish, snipe-like
  eggs, with rich brown blotches. The Ruff performs many antics while courting, but leaves all the
  work of building, incubation, and the care of the young to his mate.</p>

  <p><i>Bartramia longicauda</i>, which accidentally visits Britain, Continental Europe, and even
  Australia, inhabits North America, and migrates southward to Chili and Argentina. It is light
  brown above, varied with black, buff, and white, the long wedge-shaped tail and the under surface
  of the wing are barred, the rufous lower parts spotted, with black. The throat and belly are
  white. In winter it is a shy bird, crouching, running with jerks of the tail, or taking short
  flights; it utters a soft whistle, and lays pinkish-yellow <span class="pagenum"
  id="page286"><span class="smaller">{286}</span></span>eggs with brown spots in a slight nest on
  cultivated lands.</p>

  <p><i>Actitis hypoleucus</i>, the Common Sandpiper, breeds in many parts of Britain, and ranges
  from the Arctic Circle in Europe and Asia to the Atlantic Islands, the Mediterranean, the
  Himalayas, and Japan; it leaves us before winter, however, and migrates to most of the Ethiopian,
  Indian, and Australian Regions. The coloration is greenish-brown above, with dusky markings, and
  some white on the wings and tail; the breast is grey with dark streaks, the belly white. In winter
  the upper parts are more uniform. Rapid pebbly streams with islands, or flat stretches of sand are
  the birds' favourite resorts, where their shrill whistle and somewhat Wagtail-like habits make
  them very conspicuous; they fly, run, perch, or swim with equal ease. The nest, usually partly
  sheltered by rough vegetation or drifted rubbish, contains four reddish-buff eggs with brown and
  lilac spotting. <i>A. macularius</i>, the Spotted Sandpiper of North America generally, found in
  winter southwards to Amazonia and Brazil, is smaller, with round black spots beneath in summer; it
  lacks the nearly white eighth and ninth secondaries of its congener.</p>

  <p><i>Terekia cinerea</i>, with the up-curved beak of a Greenshank, but the habits and eggs of the
  last genus, breeds from Archangel eastward to the Pacific, leaving these haunts for the Indian
  Region to winter, when it is also found in South Africa and Australia. It is grey and black above,
  with white on the secondaries, and black scapulars, and white below streaked with dusky.</p>

  <p><i>Micropalama himantopus</i>, the long-legged Stilt-Sandpiper, inhabits the extreme North-East
  of America, migrating to Peru and Argentina. It has black, rufous, and greyish-white upper parts,
  white tail-coverts, and under parts with blackish bars; in winter the back is grey, while the bars
  nearly disappear beneath. The habits, nest, and eggs are much as in other Sandpipers.</p>

  <p>The Godwits (<i>Limosa</i>) have long legs and bills, the latter being slightly up-curved.
  <i>L. belgica</i>, the Black-tailed Godwit, nested regularly, up to about 1824, in the eastern
  counties of England, and, like the Ruff, was netted for eating. It now breeds from Iceland, the
  F&auml;roes, and Holland to Siberia and Amurland, the smaller eastern form being sometimes denominated
  <i>L. melanuro&iuml;des</i>; the winter range reaches to the Atlantic Islands, Abyssinia, Ceylon, the
  Malay Islands, Japan, Australia, and Polynesia.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page287"><span class="smaller">{287}</span></span></div>

  <p>The breeding plumage is reddish-brown and black above, with rufous crown, neck, and breast,
  marked with dusky; the rump and terminal portion of the tail are black, the basal portion,
  tail-coverts, alar bar, and belly white: in winter the upper parts are brownish, the lower grey.
  The American representative, <i>L. hudsonica</i>, occupies the barren grounds of the north, and
  migrates to Patagonia and the Falkland Islands; it has black instead of nearly white axillaries.
  Though rarer in Britain than the succeeding species during the passage in autumn and spring, small
  flocks of fairly tame Black-tailed Godwits then frequent our muddy shores and
  sands&ndash;especially in the south; the summer note, or yelp, is louder than the winter cry. Four
  elongated pear-shaped eggs, of a dull olive shade with brown markings, are deposited in a slightly
  lined hollow in some grassy marsh. The males of Godwits constantly incubate. <i>L. lapponica</i>,
  the shorter-legged Bar-tailed Godwit, inhabits the countries from Finmark eastward to about the
  Taimyr Peninsula, where it meets the race <i>L. uropygialis</i>, which extends to Alaska. The
  western form migrates to the Gambia, Somaliland and North India, the eastern through Japan and
  China to the Malay Archipelago, Australia, New Zealand, and Oceania, rarely occurring in
  south-western North America. In summer the mantle is rufous-brown and black, the head and under
  parts are chestnut, with dark markings from the crown to the sides, the rump is white with a few
  dusky streaks, the tail and axillaries are white barred with brown: in winter the upper surface is
  chiefly grey, and the lower white. <i>L. uropygialis</i> has the rump also barred. The nest of the
  Bar-tailed Godwit is usually in comparatively dry spots, or even on forest-clearings, the eggs
  being brighter green and more finely marked than those of the Black-tailed species. <i>L.
  fedoa</i>, the Marbled Godwit of northern North America, which winters southwards to Central
  America and the West Indies, is distinguished by its large size and buff axillaries.</p>

  <p>The almost cosmopolitan genus <i>Numenius</i> is remarkable for its prolonged decurved bill,
  and its elongated legs. <i>N. arquata</i>, the Curlew or Whaup, breeds freely on the moorlands of
  Britain, and extends throughout Northern Europe and Asia to Lake Baikal; after breeding it visits
  the Atlantic Islands, the whole of Africa, and the Indian Region.</p>

  <p>The plumage is pale brown with darker streaks, the rump, tail, and axillaries being white, and
  the two latter barred with dark brown; the belly is white, the breast nearly so in winter. Found
  on our shores from autumn to spring, its wary habits are as well-known as its wild rippling note;
  the food consists of insects, worms, berries, and so forth; while four large pear-shaped
  olive-and-brown eggs are deposited in an ample depression formed on boggy or heathery ground.
  <i>N. cyanopus</i>, a distinct East Siberian form, met with in Australia and occasionally from New
  Guinea to Borneo in winter, has the rump-region brown and black. <i>N. tenuirostris</i>, of the
  Mediterranean and South Russia, resembles the Curlew, but is much smaller; <i>N. longirostris</i>
  of temperate North America, migrating to Central America and the Antilles, has cinnamon
  axillaries&ndash;like all the New World members of the genus&ndash;and a dark rump. The remaining
  species, or Whimbrels, have a pale central streak down the crown, less distinct in <i>N.
  borealis</i>, the Eskimo Curlew, which has rufous axillaries barred with brown, and a rump like
  the back. This bird wanders to Britain, but breeds in the extreme north of America, and in winter
  reaches the south of that Continent. <i>N. phaeopus</i>, the typical <span class="pagenum"
  id="page289"><span class="smaller">{289}</span></span>Whimbrel or May-bird, nests in the Shetlands
  and perhaps still in the Orkneys and North Ronay in the Hebrides; in summer it takes the place of
  the Curlew in the F&auml;roes and Iceland, strays to Greenland, and occupies Northern Europe and Asia;
  while it visits the Azores, the whole of Africa, the Indian Region, and Australia in winter.
  Specimens from Eastern Asia, with more streaked rumps, have been separated as <i>N.
  variegatus</i>. In general plumage and habits the Whimbrel resembles the Curlew; it is, however,
  much smaller, the cry consists of sharper and more quickly repeated notes, and the parents, though
  anxious, are less shy at the nest. They often descend in a gyrating fashion, closing one wing.
  <i>N. hudsonicus</i>, of Arctic North America, which winters throughout South America, and has
  once occurred in Spain, resembles <i>N. borealis</i> in its cinnamon axillaries, but is larger and
  less ruddy beneath. <i>N. tahitiensis</i>, common in the Pacific Islands, and probably breeding in
  Alaska, is recognisable by the bristly-pointed flank-feathers; <i>N. minutus</i>, ranging from
  East Siberia in summer to the Malay Islands and Australia in winter, has the back of the
  metatarsus as well as the front scutellated.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Scolopacinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Macrorhamphus griseus</i>, the Dowitcher, breeding in
  the extreme north of North America, and its larger and brighter western race, <i>M.
  scolopaceus</i>, are rufous birds with darker variegations, the lower back and tail being white,
  but the latter and its upper coverts shewing blackish barring. The bill is widened towards the
  tip, while in winter the plumage is grey and white. One form or the other has strayed to Britain,
  Western Europe, and Eastern Asia, the range on migration reaching Brazil and Chili. The habits
  resemble those of Redshanks. <i>M. taczanowskii</i>, with black-mottled rump, occupies East
  Siberia, and winters in India, Borneo, and thence to China.</p>

  <p><i>Scolopax rusticula</i>, the well-known Woodcock, brown, grey, and buff in colour, with
  blackish vermiculations and blotches above and bars below, has two transverse buff stripes on the
  black hind-crown. It inhabits Northern and Central Europe and Asia&ndash;with the Atlantic Islands
  and Japan&ndash;and migrates to the Mediterranean, Persia, India, Ceylon, and China, or even
  strays to eastern North America. Breeding freely in Britain, where large additional flocks arrive
  in autumn, it frequents leaf-strewn woods in which marshy spots or rivulets alternate with dry
  ground; the food consists of worms, small molluscs and insects, the first being <span
  class="pagenum" id="page290"><span class="smaller">{290}</span></span>obtained by probing the soil
  with the long sensitive beak. The flight is rapid and steady, the note&ndash;not uttered when
  flushed&ndash;is whistling; while during incubation a curious habit prevails among the cocks of
  "roading" or traversing fixed routes at twilight, and uttering hoarse notes. The nest is a
  depression, usually lined with dry leaves; the four eggs, much larger and rounder than those of
  the Snipe, are creamy-buff with pale brown, grey, and lilac markings. The young are often carried
  by the parents between their thighs, the bill probably aiding to steady them. Woodcocks are now
  seldom snared or netted in England. <i>S. saturata</i> of Java and North-West New Guinea is a
  darker bird with almost uniform black primaries, and a white abdomen with dusky bars. <i>S.
  rochusseni</i> of the Moluccas has partly bare tibiae, like many Snipe, and a nearly plain buff
  breast. The Woodcock of eastern North America is <i>Philohela minor</i>, which has the three outer
  primaries curiously attenuated.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Gallinago</i> differs from the above in having longitudinal stripes on the head.
  <i>G. caelestis</i>, the Common or Full Snipe,<a id="NtA_190" href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a>
  breeds in Northern and Central Europe and Asia, and even in North Italy; it is recorded from
  Greenland and the Bermudas, and migrates to the Atlantic Islands, the Gambia, the Upper Nile, and
  the Indian Region. Its brown, black, and buff plumage, with three buff streaks on the head, is
  well-known, while there are normally fourteen rectrices. <i>G. sabinii</i> is merely a dark form.
  As regards its autumnal influx and food the Snipe resembles the Woodcock, but the cry of
  "scape-scape" and twisting <span class="pagenum" id="page291"><span
  class="smaller">{291}</span></span>flight on rising, remain to be mentioned, while the alternate
  zig-zag rise and fall of the bird when circling in the air near its nest, with the curious
  drumming or bleating noise produced at each descent must not be omitted. The method of production
  of this sound is still uncertain, but is either due to the vibration of the wings, or more
  probably to that of the webs of the outer rectrices. The slight nest is formed in a tuft of
  herbage in some marshy place, the four pointed eggs being olive, with spots and oblique blotches
  of brown. Snipe occasionally perch on trees or squat upon the ground until touched. The very
  similar <i>G. delicata</i> (<i>wilsoni</i>), breeding northwards from the northern United States,
  and migrating to northern South America, has usually sixteen rectrices, as have the six following
  species. <i>G. major</i>, the Double or Solitary Snipe, nests as far south in Europe as Holland
  and Poland, and reaches the Yenesei; it is known from the Tian-Shan Mountains, Turkestan, and
  Persia, and winters even in Natal and Damara-Land, visiting Britain annually on passage. It rises
  silently and heavily when flushed, is to some extent nocturnal, and drums when on the ground. The
  three outer tail-feathers are chiefly white.<a id="NtA_191" href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a>
  <i>G. frenata</i>, ranging from Argentina and Tarapac&aacute; to Venezuela and Guiana; <i>G. nobilis</i>
  of Colombia and Ecuador, <i>G. paraguaiae</i>, reaching from Amazonia and Bolivia to the
  Falklands, <i>G. macrodactyla</i> (<i>bernieri</i>) of Madagascar, and <i>G. aequatorialis</i>
  (<i>nigripennis</i>), of the Ethiopian Region generally, conclude this section of the genus. <i>G.
  australis</i> is similar to our Snipe, but larger; it breeds in Japan, and migrates through
  Formosa to Australia; <i>G. nemoricola</i>, the Wood-Snipe of the hills of India and Burma, has
  the lower parts distinctly barred; <i>G. solitaria</i>, breeding at considerable elevations from
  Turkestan to Assam and Japan, and wintering in those countries and China, exhibits distinct white
  streaks above. In the three last-named species the rectrices number about eighteen, in the next
  six they may be as few as fourteen. South America furnishes five forms somewhat like Woodcocks in
  their habits and eggs, namely, <i>G. gigantea</i> of Brazil and Paraguay, the largest of the
  Snipes; <i>G. undulata</i> of Guiana; <i>G. jamesoni</i>, ranging from Colombia to Bolivia; <i>G.
  imperialis</i> of the former country; and <i>G. stricklandi</i> of Chili and Patagonia. All these
  recall the Common Snipe by their coloration, as does the small short-winged <i>G. aucklandica</i>,
  which, with its different races, <span class="pagenum" id="page292"><span
  class="smaller">{292}</span></span>occupies the Auckland, Snares, Chatham, and Antipodes Islands,
  and has visited New Zealand. <i>G. stenura</i>, the Pin-tailed Snipe, with twenty-six rectrices,
  the eight outer of which on each side are stiff and attenuated, breeds from the Yenesei to the
  Pacific, and winters in the Indian Region; <i>G. megala</i>, with twelve of its twenty
  tail-feathers narrowed, inhabits East Siberia and passes through Japan to China, the Philippines,
  Borneo, and the Moluccas in winter. <i>G.</i> (<i>Limnocryptes</i>) <i>gallinula</i>, the Jack
  Snipe, found in Britain from autumn to spring, breeds from Scandinavia to Siberia, and migrates to
  North Africa, the Indian Region, and Japan. The upper parts show a greenish and purple gloss,
  while it has only twelve rectrices. Like <i>G. major</i>, it frequents drier spots than the Common
  Snipe, and rises without a sound in the shooting season, the flight being butterfly-like; the
  habits in summer are similar to those of the last-named species, and the eggs even larger for its
  size.</p>

  <p>Of the so-called Painted Snipes the female of <i>Rhynchaea</i> or <i>Rostratula capensis</i>
  has a brown head with chestnut cheeks and collar, a brownish-green back with blackish freckling,
  scattered golden-buff ocelli and streaks on the upper parts, a black fore-neck, a white under
  surface and ring round the eye. The male is duller, without the chestnut tints. This species
  inhabits the whole Ethiopian and most of the Indian Region, as well as Egypt, Arabia, and Japan;
  the larger <i>R. australis</i>, with only a chestnut patch on the nape, occupies Australia. <i>R.
  semicollaris</i> of Chili and Patagonia, which visits Peru and Brazil, shews no chestnut collar,
  but has black upper wing-coverts with round white spots; the sexes being alike. In mature females
  of the Old World forms the trachea extends in a loop or loops over the furcula, or even over the
  pectoral muscles.<a id="NtA_192" href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> The habits of these birds are
  Snipe-like, but the flight is slower, and the hen's note purring; the whitish eggs with plentiful
  black spots are somewhat Plover-like, while <i>R. semicollaris</i> apparently lays only two. The
  Indian species is said to hiss at intruders, with its wings and tail expanded into a disc.</p>

  <p>The short-winged <i>Phegornis mitchelli</i>, which lacks a hallux, is brown above, and white
  with very close dusky bars below; the head is black, save for a white band which surrounds the
  occiput; while a neck-collar is formed by a fine orange patch behind and a white area in front. It
  inhabits the Andes from Peru to Chili.</p>

  <p>Fam. II. <b>Chionididae.</b>&ndash;This group&ndash;with <i>Dromas</i>&ndash;possibly <span
  class="pagenum" id="page293"><span class="smaller">{293}</span></span>connects the Charadriidae
  and the Laridae. The peculiar bill and short, entirely reticulated metatarsus have already been
  mentioned (pp.&nbsp;<a href="#page268">268</a>-<a href="#page269">269</a>), while both sexes are
  pure white, the downy young being grey. <i>Chionis alba</i>, the "Kelp Pigeon" of the Falklands,
  which inhabits the Straits of Magellan, New Year Island, South Georgia and Louis-Philippe Land,
  and has once been shot in Ireland, has the bill pinkish or yellowish with a black tip and flat
  sheath; the bare face is covered with whitish papillae, and the feet are bluish. <i>C. minor</i>,
  of Kerguelen Land, Prince Edward and Marion Islands, and the Crozets, has the sheath protuberant,
  the bill and facial caruncle black, and the feet pinkish. There is said to be a blunt black carpal
  spur, less prominent in the female. Both species are often found at sea, flying strongly, or
  sailing with outspread wings; but on land their appearance, gait, and manner of courting are
  curiously like those of Pigeons. The note is a gentle chuckle; the food consists of
  mussels&ndash;which they break with ease&ndash;crustaceans, sea-weed, and even eggs of other
  birds; their own eggs, two or rarely three in number, are of the Oyster-catcher type, but commonly
  redder in the markings, so that they recall those of the Razor-bill or Tropic-bird. When the
  flocks separate into pairs for breeding, they are tame and inquisitive, while they fashion a nest
  of dried plant-stems in hollows among rocks, or occasionally in Petrels' burrows.</p>

  <p>Fam. III. <b>Glareolidae.</b>&ndash;Of these Old World forms Sub-fam. 1, <i>Glareolinae</i>,
  includes the genera <i>Glareola</i>, <i>Cursorius</i>, <i>Pluvianus</i>, and perhaps
  <i>Ortyxelus</i>, the first two having the middle claw pectinated, and <i>Glareola</i> a short,
  stout bill with wide gape, a forked tail, and long pointed wings. <i>G. pratincola</i>, the
  Pratincole, which occasionally visits Britain by way of Western France, breeds in Southern Europe
  and North Africa, and extends to Sind and the Tian-Shan Mountains in Asia, migrating to other
  parts of India and to South Africa. It is brown above, with blacker wings and tail, the
  secondaries having white tips, and the rectrices white bases and coverts; the throat is buff,
  surrounded by a black line, the breast brownish, the abdomen white; the axillaries and inner under
  wing-coverts are chestnut, the bill and feet blackish, with red base to the former. <i>G.
  orientalis</i>, found from Mongolia to Ceylon, the Malay Archipelago, and North Australia, has the
  tail less forked and little white on the secondaries; <i>G. ocularis</i>, of Madagascar, recorded
  from Mauritius and East Africa, has a pale chestnut <span class="pagenum" id="page294"><span
  class="smaller">{294}</span></span>breast, and the outer pair of rectrices white with broad black
  ends; <i>G. melanoptera</i> (<i>nordmanni</i>) of South-East Europe and West Asia, migrating to
  South Africa, has black axillaries and under wing-coverts, as have the long-legged <i>G.
  grallaria</i> (<i>isabella</i>) with slightly forked tail and chestnut flanks, which breeds in
  Eastern Australia and occurs from New Guinea to Borneo, and the small grey-backed <i>G. lactea</i>
  of India, Ceylon, and Burma, with much white on the wings. The other species have reddish feet,
  fading to yellow; <i>G. cinerea</i>, ranging from the Niger to the Congo, possesses a rufous
  nuchal collar and white axillaries; <i>G. nuchalis</i> of the White Nile, and the hardly separable
  <i>G. emini</i> of Foda in Equatorial Africa, have a white collar and grey axillaries; <i>G.
  megapoda</i>, extending from Liberia to the Niger, shews a rufous collar and grey axillaries. The
  last five forms, and <i>G. ocularis</i>, have the tail merely emarginated. Pratincoles have a
  shrill, screaming note and Swallow-like flight, insects, on which they feed, being ordinarily
  captured on the wing; but the general habits are those of Plovers, the birds running very fast,
  and the parents often swooping down upon an intruder, or cowering on the ground to draw attention
  from their brood. They frequent sand-banks, lagoons, bare plains, or coast-lands, laying two,
  three, or rarely four oval greenish-buff or greyish eggs, with purplish-black, brown, and grey
  marblings, without any nest, on the sun-baked mud.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cursorius</i>, or Courser, inhabits the hotter portions of the Old World. <i>C.
  gallicus</i>, the Cream-coloured Courser, which visits Britain and the southern half of Europe
  irregularly, is met with in the Canary and Cape Verd Islands, North Africa, and the countries from
  Arabia to Northern India. The brown bill is thick and decurved, the whitish legs are long; the
  plumage is buff, with slaty nape, black remiges, axillaries, under wing-coverts, and subterminal
  tail-bar; the face is white with a black post-ocular streak. Seldom found in flocks, this bird
  frequents dry sandy plains and deserts, crouching to avoid notice, running with extraordinary
  speed if approached, but rarely rising on the wing. The flight, however, is at times protracted.
  The food consists almost entirely of insects, such as grasshoppers, yet it includes small
  molluscs; the note is harsh; while two, or exceptionally three, round stone-coloured eggs with
  grey and brown markings are deposited on the bare ground. The axillaries and under wing-coverts
  are greyish-buff in <i>C. somalensis</i>, of Somaliland, but brownish-grey in <i>C. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page295"><span class="smaller">{295}</span></span>rufus</i>, of South Africa,
  which has a black abdominal patch. <i>C. temmincki</i> (<i>senegalensis</i>), of most of the
  Ethiopian Region, and <i>C. coromandelicus</i>, of India and Ceylon, are similar, but have the
  nape black and white, the latter possessing white tail-coverts.</p>

  <p>In the remaining species (<i>Rhinoptilus</i> of some authors) the bill is almost straight.
  <i>C. bicinctus</i> of South Africa is mottled with brown above, having much chestnut on the
  wings, white tail-coverts, and buff under parts crossed by two black pectoral bars. <i>C.
  bisignatus</i>, ranging from East Africa to Benguela, and <i>C. hartingi</i> of Somali-Land, are
  hardly more than races of the above. <i>C. cinctus</i> of East Equatorial Africa, and the barely
  separable <i>C. seebohmi</i> of South-West Africa, are easily recognised by the four bands on the
  white lower surface, the highest and lowest being brown, and the two intermediate black, with a
  streaky buff space between them. <i>C. chalcopterus</i>, of the Ethiopian Region generally, and
  <i>C. albifasciatus</i> with a more distinct white alar bar, are plain brown birds with metallic
  purple hues on the black primaries, white post-ocular streak and throat, and white belly
  surmounted by a black band. <i>C. bitorquatus</i>, of the districts near Madras, differs in
  shewing below three successive bands or gorgets, one of rufous and two of brown, separated by
  white. Though all Coursers agree in general habits, the last three seem to prefer bushy ground,
  and <i>C. rufus</i> will perch in trees.</p>

  <p><i>Pluvianus aegyptius</i>, apparently allied to <i>Cursorius</i>, inhabits West and North-East
  Africa, wandering to Palestine and South Europe, and being even recorded from Sweden. The head,
  nape, and long mantle-feathers overhanging the grey back are glossy black; the wings and tail are
  black and white varied with grey, the lower parts rufous-white with a black pectoral band, while a
  line of white encircles the crown. This bird, called "Zic-zac" from its noisy chattering cry (cf.
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page276">276</a></span>), is usually seen skimming swiftly over the
  water, or running and feeding along the shores. The yellowish stone-coloured eggs, with umber and
  grey markings, are commonly found buried in the sand, but so are those of the Ringed Plover in
  wind-swept spots. Probably this species, and not <i>Hoplopterus spinosus</i>, is the <span
  title="trochilos" class="fsn">&tau;&rho;&omicron;&chi;&#x03AF;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> of
  Herodotus, the Crocodile-bird of later writers, which enters the Crocodile's mouth to feed.</p>

  <p>Here may possibly be placed the mottled rufous, black, and white <i>Ortyxelus meiffreni</i> of
  West and North-East Africa.<a id="NtA_193" href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page296"><span class="smaller">{296}</span></span></div>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Dromadinae.</i>&ndash;This contains only <i>Dromas ardeola</i>, the curious
  Crab-Plover, with its straight, hard compressed bill, long legs, webbed toes, and pectinated
  middle claw. It is white, with the elongated dorsal feathers and most of the wings black, the tail
  chiefly grey. Found from the Red Sea to Natal, and through the Indian Ocean to the Bay of Bengal,
  it haunts sandy islands or sandbanks on the coast, flying, running, or walking with equal ease.
  This bird feeds on small crustaceans, and breeds in company, depositing a single large white egg
  on the bare sand in a deep burrow, where the young remain for a considerable time.</p>

  <p>Fam. IV. <b>Thinocorythidae.</b>&ndash;The so-called South American Seed-Snipes are a
  generalized group of somewhat Fowl-like birds, with long wings and short legs. <i>Thinocorys
  rumicivorus</i>, of Peru, Bolivia, Chili, Argentina, and Patagonia, is yellowish-brown and black
  above, with whitish tips to the dark remiges and rectrices, and creamy white below with a black
  pectoral band, which sends a streak upwards to bifurcate round the white throat. The female has a
  less extensive band, and an ashy-brown fore-neck. <i>T. orbignianus</i>, of Peru, Chili, and
  Bolivia, differs in its grey breast with no central streak; it has a black border to the throat,
  and a grey nape, which is absent in the female. <i>Attagis gayi</i>, of the same countries, has
  grey and rufous upper parts with black spots and vermiculations, and pale cinnamon under parts,
  with a greyish fore-neck shewing fine black lines. <i>A. chimborazensis</i> of Ecuador is blacker
  above and darker below; <i>A. malouina</i>, of the Straits of Magellan and the Falkland Islands,
  has a white lower surface and a rufous chest with round black spots. These forms usually frequent
  hill-country, and to the north of their range even haunt the higher Andes, living on vegetable
  substances, and especially seeds of docks and other plants. They run with great celerity over the
  stony ravines or grassy plains, but they often squat or creep away from intruders; when flushed
  they rise sharply with twisting flight like the Snipe, and utter a similar cry. On the ground they
  make curious hollow or whistling noises, the flocks answering one another as they sit, and being
  very hard to distinguish, from their earthy coloration. The nest of <i>Thinocorys</i> is a
  depression slightly lined with grass, and contains some four drab or pinkish-buff pear-shaped
  eggs, thickly speckled with chocolate and purplish-grey, which the female is said to cover when
  she leaves them, while the male anxiously keeps watch from some neighbouring stone.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page297"><span class="smaller">{297}</span></span></div>

  <p>Fam. V. <b>Oedicnemidae.</b>&ndash;Of these birds, which lack the hind toe, <i>Oedicnemus
  scolopax</i>, the Stone-Curlew, or Norfolk Plover, a summer visitor to the warrens of East Anglia,
  and the downs or stony flats of the South of England, ranges from our shores and the Atlantic
  Islands through temperate Europe and North Africa to Lake Saisan and Burma in Asia. This largest
  of European Plovers is light brown above and buff below, with blackish streaks throughout; the
  throat, belly, a line below the eye, and two narrow alar bars are white, the remiges otherwise
  black, the tail brown, black, and white. The feet, base of the bill, and very large iris are
  yellow. This skulking semi-nocturnal species flies strongly, though it prefers to squat or run,
  and takes to the wing reluctantly; towards winter it is gregarious, as are so many of the
  Charadriiformes. The mournful whistling cry, more mellow than that of the Golden Plover, is
  chiefly heard at twilight, when the bird feeds upon worms, insects, molluscs, or even reptiles,
  frogs, and mice. Two oval stone-coloured eggs, blotched or scrawled with black, are laid on bare
  ground or among stones, and in India sometimes under bushes; while the newly-hatched young are
  decidedly torpid, contrary to Limicoline custom. Other species with streaked breasts are <i>Oe.
  senegalensis</i>, of West and North-East Africa, with only one white wing-bar; <i>Oe.
  vermiculatus</i>, of East and South Africa, with vermiculated upper parts; <i>Oe. capensis</i>, of
  much the same districts, with coarse blotches and bars above; and the large <i>Oe. grallarius</i>
  of Australia with a broad brown stripe down each side of the neck. <i>Oe. affinis</i> of
  North-East Africa is barely distinct from <i>Oe. capensis</i>. The forms with almost uniform
  breasts, and a black patch or line over the eye, are <i>Oe. bistriatus</i>,<a id="NtA_194"
  href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> ranging from Mexico to North Brazil, with mottled, and <i>Oe.
  superciliaris</i> of Peru with vermiculated, back; as well as two fine birds separated as
  <i>Aesacus</i>. <i>Ae. recurvirostris</i>, of India, Ceylon, and Burma, has a stout, slightly
  recurved bill and nearly plain upper surface; <i>Ae. magnirostris</i>, extending from the Andaman
  Islands to the Philippines, Australia, the Solomons, and New Caledonia, differs in its straight
  bill and blackish lores. The former breeds on sand-banks up rivers, the latter on sea-beaches,
  both feeding upon crustaceans and molluscs. Some of the Family occasionally frequent low hills,
  and <i>Oe. bistriatus</i> is kept to destroy insects in Nicaragua.</p>

  <p>Fam. VI. <b>Parridae.</b>&ndash;Of the extraordinary long-toed Ja&ccedil;anas, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page298"><span class="smaller">{298}</span></span><i>Parra jacana</i>, ranging from Ecuador
  and Guiana to Bolivia and Argentina, has a red frontal lappet, bilobed posteriorly, a red wattle
  at each side of the gape, an orange bill, olive feet, and a well-developed yellow carpal spur. The
  plumage is chestnut, with greenish-black head, neck, and under parts, maroon sides, and yellow
  remiges, the wing- and tail-quills being tipped with brownish-black. <i>P. melanopygia</i> of
  Panama and Colombia is darker and more maroon above; <i>P. nigra</i>, of those countries and
  Venezuela, is entirely greenish-black, except for the wings; <i>P. gymnostoma</i>
  (<i>variabilis</i>), found from South Texas to Costa Rica, with Cuba, Porto Rico, and Haiti, has
  the frontal lappet trilobed, lacks the rictal wattles, and in colour resembles <i>P.
  melanopygia</i>, though the maroon extends to the belly. The young in this genus are chiefly
  bronzy-brown above and buffish-white below; and the nestlings&ndash;at least in <i>P.
  gymnostoma</i>&ndash;are curiously marked with tawny, black, buff, and white. <i>Metopidius
  indicus</i>, occurring from India to Cochin China, and in Sumatra, Java, and Celebes, has a large
  blue frontal shield, small blunt spurs, and no rictal wattles; the bill is pink, blue, and green;
  the feet are slaty. The head, neck, remiges, and under parts are greenish-black, varying to
  purple, the chin and superciliary streak are white, the mantle is bronze, the lower back maroon,
  and the tail chestnut. The young are much greener above than in the last genus. <i>M.
  albinucha</i> of Madagascar and <i>M. africanus</i> of most of the Ethiopian Region have a smaller
  shield, loosely connected behind, which is grey in the former, leaden blue in the latter, as are
  the bill and feet. The cinnamon-brown plumage is varied in the first-named by a black occiput and
  throat and white nape, in its congener by a white neck, black nape, and golden upper breast. The
  tail is chestnut and the primaries black. The very small <i>Microparra capensis</i>, of South and
  South-East Africa, has no shield or wattles, and is greyish-brown, becoming orange on the crown,
  rump, and tail; the nape and upper mantle are purplish-black, the wings blackish with a white alar
  bar, the under parts white with golden sides to the neck. The bill and feet are brownish, the spur
  in this genus and the next being as in <i>Metopidius</i>. <i>Hydralector gallinaceus</i>, ranging
  from Borneo and Celebes to New Guinea and Australia&ndash;if <i>H. novae guineae</i> be not
  separated&ndash;is chiefly black; the back being greyish-olive, the throat and abdomen white, the
  cheeks, with the sides and front of the neck, golden. A red lappet with an erect central
  protuberance covers the forehead; the bill is <span class="pagenum" id="page299"><span
  class="smaller">{299}</span></span>red, yellow, and black; the legs are red and olive. Young birds
  are mainly reddish-brown, with white below. <i>Hydrophasianus chirurgus</i>, of most of the Indian
  Region, is bronzy-brown above and purplish-black below, with no fleshy outgrowths, but a large,
  sharp spur. The head is white with black occiput, the neck golden behind and white in front, with
  an intervening black lateral stripe; the wings are mainly white, with curious filamentous
  appendages to the attenuated blackish outer primaries; the four median feathers of the dark brown
  tail are enormously elongated and decurved. The winter and immature plumage is almost entirely
  bronzy-brown, with white under surface crossed by a black gorget; but the young have a rufous
  head.</p>

      chirurgus.</i> &times; &frac14;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>All the members of this Family frequent lakes and swamps, whether inland or near the coast,
  <i>Hydrophasianus chirurgus</i> occurring at considerable elevations; while at least that species,
  <i>Parra jacana</i>, and <i>Metopidius indicus</i>, are gregarious in winter. On their favourite
  lagoons, bordered by a dense fringe of aquatic plants, these active birds may be seen gracefully
  striding or running upon the floating leaves of water-lilies and like plants, as their long toes
  easily enable them to do. When danger threatens they crouch or submerge themselves partially,
  <i>Hydralector</i> being perhaps the best diver, where all are good. Tame when unmolested, they
  rise reluctantly, scuttling over the water with <span class="pagenum" id="page300"><span
  class="smaller">{300}</span></span>trailing legs after the fashion of a Moor-hen, or fluttering
  and gliding in turn to the nearest shelter at a good pace. On the ground the gait is easy. Small
  parties of <i>Parra jacana</i> are said to gather together when feeding, and to utter quick,
  excited cries, while going through a singular performance or dance, with outstretched, agitated
  wings and alternate slow and fluttering movements.<a id="NtA_195"
  href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> Some species are especially quarrelsome; <i>Microparra</i> has
  a habit of bobbing its head up and down like a Plover; the male of <i>Parra jacana</i> is
  particularly sedulous in warning the female from the nest; and both parents commonly "sham
  wounded" to protect their young. The cry is loud and harsh, or mewing in <i>Hydrophasianus</i>;
  the food consists of insects, molluscs, seeds, and roots; the nest is a small cup, or not
  uncommonly a large mass, of aquatic herbage, placed in grass or rushes, or on floating vegetation.
  The four beautiful eggs are more or less pear-shaped, and are glossy buff, olive, green, or brown,
  thickly covered with fantastic scrawls, and occasionally with black or brown blotches.
  <i>Metopidius indicus</i>, however, is said to lay as many as ten, while those of
  <i>Hydrophasianus</i> are plain brown or green.</p>

  <p>A fossil Limicoline form, <i>Palaeotringa</i>, occurs in the Cretaceous rocks of New Jersey;
  France furnishes <i>Limosa</i> and <i>Tringa</i> from the Eocene, <i>Camascelus</i> (allied to the
  Plovers) from the transition beds, <i>Milnea</i> (near <i>Oedicnemus</i>), <i>Tringa</i>,
  <i>Himantopus</i>, and <i>Numenius</i> from the Miocene. The same formation in both France and
  Germany provides <i>Helornis</i> (akin to <i>Limicola</i>), and <i>Totanus</i>; the Pliocene of
  Italy the latter; <i>Gallinago</i> is found in the Chatham Islands; <i>Charadrius</i> in North
  America.</p>

  <p>Fam. VII. <b>Laridae.</b>&ndash;This consists of four Sub-families (1) <i>Stercorariinae</i> or
  Skuas, (2) <i>Larinae</i> or Gulls, (3) <i>Rhynchopinae</i> or Skimmers, and (4) <i>Sterninae</i>
  or Terns. Mr. Saunders<a id="NtA_196" href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> is, however, probably
  right in distinguishing a second Family, <i>Stercorariidae</i>; and possibly a third,
  <i>Rhynchopidae</i>, might be admitted.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Larinae</i> the strong, horny bill is of moderate length, though exceptionally small
  in <i>Rhodostethia</i>, the maxilla being curved, but hardly hooked; in the <i>Stercorariinae</i>
  there is a distinct hook, and the base is covered by a cere, said to be hard or soft according to
  the season, and possibly, shed after the manner of certain Auks.<a id="NtA_197"
  href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> In the <i>Sterninae</i> the beak is nearly straight and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page301"><span class="smaller">{301}</span></span>pointed, while comparatively
  slender; in the <i>Rhynchopinae</i>, the maxilla, which moves vertically with ease, is much
  shorter than the mandible, and both are compressed anteriorly until they resemble truncated knife
  blades. The tibia is generally partly bare; the metatarsus is fairly long in the first two
  Sub-families, and is scutellated in front, being usually smooth behind, though rougher in
  <i>Pagophila</i>; the anterior toes are fully webbed, with claws which vary from weak to moderate,
  or even to strong and hooked, as in the <i>Stercorariinae</i>. The elevated hallux is joined by a
  membrane to the inner toe in <i>Leucophaeus</i>, and is rudimentary or absent in <i>Rissa</i>. In
  the <i>Sterninae</i> and <i>Rhynchopinae</i> the metatarsus is short&ndash;especially in the
  latter, where the web between the inner and middle digits is deeply incised, as are both webs in
  <i>Hydrochelidon</i> and <i>Gygis</i>; the claws are long, slender, and curved. The pointed wings,
  excessively lengthened in the two last-mentioned Sub-families, have eleven primaries, of which the
  outer is particularly small, and from fifteen to twenty-three secondaries. The tail may be nearly
  even as in <i>Larus</i>, deeply forked as in <i>Sterna</i> generally, less excised as in
  <i>Xema</i>, <i>Hydrochelidon</i>, <i>Naenia</i>, and <i>Rhynchops</i>, graduated or cuneate as in
  <i>Rhodostethia</i>, <i>Anous</i>, and <i>Gygis</i>; all the twelve feathers being rounded or
  acute: in the <i>Stercorariinae</i> the two central rectrices project beyond the others, being
  decidedly pointed in <i>Stercorarius crepidatus</i> and <i>S. parasiticus</i>, but rounded and
  twisted in the shaft until the webs are vertical in <i>S. pomatorhinus</i>. The furcula is <span
  class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the syrinx tracheo-bronchial, the tongue lanceolate, the
  nostrils are pervious; an after-shaft is present, while both adults and young have abundant down,
  that of the latter commonly shewing a mixture of white, with grey, yellowish, slaty, or brown.
  <i>Naenia</i> has elongated plumes at the gape, and a few Terns have slight nuchal crests.</p>

  <p>Gulls and Skuas are widely-ranging and essentially marine birds, even those species which nest
  inland being commonly observed near salt water, and seeking the coast when incubation is over.
  They are always inclined to be gregarious, and are more or less resident in Britain, but the
  undoubted influx of birds from abroad in autumn makes it difficult, or even impossible, to
  determine their exact status in every case. Their untiring and easy flight is only second to that
  of the larger Petrels; the majestic style of the Great Black-backed Gull, and other forms, being a
  great contrast to the wavering but graceful movements of the Kittiwake or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page302"><span class="smaller">{302}</span></span>Bonaparte's Gull. All walk well, though
  sedately, swim to perfection, and rise easily both from land and water, usually breaking into a
  run before taking to the wing from the ground; while they almost invariably alight with uplifted
  pinions. The wild characteristic note varies less than in most large groups, that of the bigger
  species being harsh and querulous, that of the smaller laughing or screaming; the lesser Skuas
  give vent to a curious mewing cry, and the Great Skuas to a similar but deeper sound. At the
  breeding-quarters the utterances are naturally more agitated and shrill, and the parents hang
  excitedly above a visitor's head. The food consists mainly of fish, molluscs, crustaceans, and
  worms, but is varied in the stronger forms by small mammals, young birds, and eggs: the Great
  Black-backed Gull undoubtedly attacks lambs and weakly ewes; carrion is not uncommonly devoured;
  and <i>Larus maculipennis</i> acts as a scavenger at Buenos Aires, besides clearing the country of
  grasshoppers, and robbing the Cayenne Lapwing of its insect booty. Skuas give chase to their
  smaller kin, and force them to disgorge the fishes they have just caught, while even Solan Geese
  are sometimes victimized; <i>Larus scopulinus</i>, moreover, which robs the Oyster-catcher of New
  Zealand, is a further instance of parasitic habits. Insects and their larvae, turnips, berries,
  and grain are also eaten by these omnivorous but useful creatures. Their main sustenance is
  naturally derived from the ocean, or its oozy shores; but flocks are commonly seen on pastures and
  arable lands near the beach, or following the plough further from the sea, though not being of the
  species which breed in the interior, nor driven inland by stress of weather. At times Gulls
  almost, if not quite, disappear below the water when swooping on their prey, and Kittiwakes have
  been said to pursue it beneath the surface. A common habit is that of preening and washing the
  plumage in company at favoured spots, while one that is less well-known is that of casting up the
  indigestible parts of the food in pellets, as do many other birds. The nesting sites are very
  frequently precipitous rocks and stony islands, but inland marshes and lakes accommodate many
  species, while in certain localities trees as high as thirty feet are selected. Skuas breed on
  moors or hills near the sea in Scotland, on the fells of Scandinavia, and on the tundras and
  barren grounds of the Arctic Regions, the nest being a mere depression in the herbage or moss; the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page303"><span class="smaller">{303}</span></span>remainder of the tribe
  generally collect a mass of grass, moss, flags, sedges, heather, twigs, or sea-weed, though a mere
  hollow in the soil or sand often serves their purpose. The eggs vary in number from two in the
  case of the Ivory Gull and the Skuas to three or exceptionally four; they are brown, drab, or
  green, with blotches and spots of brown, black, grey, and lilac, and recall those of Plovers. Both
  sexes have been said to incubate in <i>Larus minutus</i> and <i>Rissa brevirostris</i>; the young
  are comparatively helpless for a few hours or perhaps days, and are at first fed by the
  parents.</p>

  <p>Terns resemble Gulls in many of their habits, but are more cosmopolitan, and decidedly
  migratory in Britain; they are essentially marine, yet some species breed on inland waters in
  summer. Particularly slender and graceful, these long-winged birds may usually be distinguished by
  their irregular or hovering flight, and are known as Sea-swallows; while their method of beating
  up and down maritime streams or shallows, singly or in pairs, in search of fish, is quite peculiar
  to themselves. At such times they make constant plunges into the water, often completely immersing
  their bodies, or occasionally discontinue their operations to engage in trivial and seemingly
  amicable quarrels. The note, though hoarse in some cases, is usually a squealing or grating sound,
  the latter especially when disturbed; the food consists of fish and crustaceans,
  insects&ndash;said to be sometimes taken on the wing&ndash;frogs, newts, locusts, grasshoppers,
  caterpillars, leeches, molluscs, and medusae. Terns are wary but bold, commonly circling around a
  wounded companion until several are shot; the Noddies (<i>Anous</i>), however, are much more
  sluggish and silent. On the ground all move with comparative ease. The nest of
  <i>Hydrochelidon</i> is a mass of water-weeds placed on some tussock in a wet inland swamp; that
  of <i>Anous</i>, when situated on trees, bushes, or rocky ledges, is composed of twigs, sea-weed,
  and like materials; but most species merely make a hole in the sand or soil, with little or no
  lining. Depressions on level rocks, the surface of prostrate plants, and heathery, grassy, or
  muddy flats are often utilized as alternatives, while colonies are usually formed. Two or three
  olive, reddish-brown, green, or stone-coloured eggs, with blotches, spots, scrawls, or oblique
  streaks of black, brown, grey, or lilac, are deposited; the Noddy and Sooty Terns, however, have a
  single white egg with red markings, and <i>Gygis</i> one, which is buff, marbled, spotted, or
  often scrolled with brown and grey, and is laid on any slight cavity of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page304"><span class="smaller">{304}</span></span>a branch, a broad leaf-stalk, or a coral
  reef. The nesting habits of <i>Naenia</i> are unknown, but it frequents rocky, cavernous
  shores.</p>

  <p><i>Rhynchops</i> has a peculiarly low flight, rapid and gliding, with many a turn and twist,
  which has gained it the name of Skimmer. The food, often sought towards evening, appears to
  consist of small fish and crustaceans; it is procured by keeping the bill wide open, with the long
  mandible ploughing through the water or mud, and leaving a distinct furrow in its track. The cry
  is a low harsh scream or shrill twittering note. A hollow in some sandy river-bank or island
  serves to contain the three or four grey, green, buff, or white eggs, with blotches and streaks of
  purplish-grey and dark brown. The female is said to sit only at night or in stormy weather, and
  the young to be unable to fly for several weeks,<a id="NtA_198"
  href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> but the remaining habits resemble those of Terns.</p>

  <p>The sexes in the Laridae are invariably similar, the plumage being grey and white, or more
  rarely blackish or brown, details of which will be found below. The young are duller, being
  mottled with brown or black in immature Gulls. The frequent black or brown heads, often lacking at
  certain ages or times of year, the seasonal changes generally, the neck-collar of <i>Xema
  sabinii</i> and <i>Rhodostethia</i>, and the rosy tint on the breast in the latter species,
  <i>Larus franklini</i>, and <i>Sterna dougalli</i> may be noticed in passing. The members of the
  Family range in size from the Glaucous to the Little Gull; the largest Tern being the Caspian, and
  the smallest, as its name indicates, the Least Tern.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Stercorariinae.</i>&ndash;Of this widely spread but curiously distributed group,
  <i>Megalestris catarrhactes</i>, the Great Skua or Bonxie, a fine rufous-brown species, with a
  white wing-patch which is very conspicuous in flight, breeds in Shetland, the F&auml;roes, Iceland, and
  possibly north of Hudson Strait, occurring in South Greenland and Norway, and reaching New England
  and Gibraltar in winter. It nests in colonies, though each pair occupies a distinct area, which
  the parents defend with exceptional boldness, swooping down swiftly with a heavy rush, and
  dropping the feet when at close quarters, as if to strike an intruder. Unlike their smaller kin,
  which will attack a man from any side and hit him with their wings, these birds commonly aim
  directly at the face, and their onslaught, if not averted, is really dangerous, while they only
  just clear the head when threatened with a stick. The two eggs, deposited in a depression <span
  class="pagenum" id="page305"><span class="smaller">{305}</span></span>in the herbage, are dull
  brown or greenish, with somewhat indistinct umber markings. The food consists chiefly of fish,
  which the smaller Gulls are forced to disgorge, while Kittiwakes and the like are themselves
  occasionally devoured in default of other prey. <i>M. chilensis</i>, spotted with chestnut above,
  and more rufous below, occupies America south of Rio de Janeiro and Callao; the sooty-brown <i>M.
  antarctica</i>&ndash;the stouter-billed Port Egmont or Sea Hen&ndash;replacing it from the
  Falklands to the Australian and New Zealand seas, and reaching northwards to the Comoros and
  Madagascar. In the Antarctic Victoria Land occurs a paler form, <i>M. maccormicki</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Stercorarius pomatorhinus</i>, the Pomatorhine Skua, breeds on the tundras of Siberia and
  possibly from Greenland to Bering Sea, migrating to Britain and as far as South Africa, North
  Australia, and Peru. The plumage is brown, with blacker head and gorget, white breast, and
  acuminate white neck-feathers tipped with yellow. The projecting median rectrices with their
  vertically twisted vanes are mentioned above (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page301">301</a></span>). Uniform brown specimens may be immature. <i>S. crepidatus</i>,
  the Arctic Skua, is smaller, and nests as far south as Northern and Western Scotland, but properly
  occupies Arctic and sub-Arctic Europe, Asia, and America; in winter, it reaches South Africa,
  Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil. The elongated rectrices are not twisted, but are pointed,
  while a uniform dark phase&ndash;the true <i>S. richardsoni</i>&ndash;is common to both sexes.
  <i>S. parasiticus</i>, Buffon's Skua, distinguished from the last-named by its extremely prolonged
  rectrices and greyer upper surface, breeds on the Scandinavian fells and throughout the Arctic
  tundras and barren grounds, migrating as far south as Gibraltar and lat. 40&deg; N. in America. The
  habits of the members of this genus are similar to those of <i>Megalestris</i>, but their quicker
  flight enables them to rob even Terns, and the mewing cry is most peculiar, while the eggs are
  intermediate in style between those of Whimbrels and Gulls. These small Skuas often destroy
  Lemmings.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Larinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Rissa tridactyla</i>, the Kittiwake, breeds from the
  circumpolar regions southwards to the Kuril Islands, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and North-West
  France; in winter it reaches western North America, the Bermudas, the Canaries, the Mediterranean,
  and the Caspian. The feet are black, the hind-toe is absent or rudimentary. From <i>Larus
  canus</i>, which it closely resembles when flying, it can be distinguished by the absence of white
  spots at the ends of the primaries. The young bird, or <span class="pagenum" id="page306"><span
  class="smaller">{306}</span></span>Tarrock, is much variegated with dark grey or black, and has a
  blackish tip to the tail, as is the case in most fresh-water Gulls. Many fine colonies inhabit the
  loftier cliffs of Great Britain, the nests of sea-weed and grass being closely crowded together,
  and the eggs exhibiting softer colours than is usual in the Sub-family. The darker <i>R.
  brevirostris</i> of Bering Sea has red feet.</p>

  <p><i>Pagophila eburnea</i>, the Ivory Gull, seems truly circumpolar, while it accidentally visits
  Britain, Northern Europe, and New Brunswick. It is pure white, with black feet, the young shewing
  grey and black variations. It will eat whale- or seal-offal.</p>

  <p><i>Leucophaeus scoresbii</i>, of South Patagonia, the Falkland Islands, and the neighbouring
  Antarctic seas, has a crimson bill, coarse red feet, with somewhat excised webs, a dark hood in
  immature examples, and a white tail. <i>Gabianus pacificus</i> of Australia and Tasmania is
  somewhat like <i>Larus marinus</i>, but has a very short stout bill and a black-banded tail.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Larus</i>, as throughout this Family, the arrangement followed is that of Mr.
  Howard Saunders,<a id="NtA_199" href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> much of whose admirable work
  is here incorporated. His first section comprises species with a white tail but no hood, the young
  having the head striated. Of these, <i>L. glaucus</i>, the Burgomaster or Glaucous Gull, and <i>L.
  leucopterus</i>, the Iceland Gull, are the only members of the group with nearly white primaries,
  the former being larger, with proportionately shorter wings. In summer the former is circumpolar,
  and the latter occurs from Jan Mayen to Greenland and perhaps the west side of Baffin Bay; in
  winter both visit Britain, but the latter only reaches the Gulf of Gascony, and Boston in America,
  whereas its ally extends to the Mediterranean, the Caspian, Japan, California, and the Bermudas.
  At this season the head shows brown markings; while the young are entirely mottled, though they
  apparently become creamy white just before assuming the grey mantle. <i>L. glaucescens</i> of the
  North Pacific, <i>L. nelsoni</i> of North-West America, and <i>L. kumlieni</i> of Cumberland Sound
  have the quills chequered with grey, and connect the above with the following or blacker-quilled
  group.</p>

  <p><i>L. argentatus</i>, our Herring Gull, has a blue-grey mantle; the black primaries shew white
  tips and "mirrors" or round white marks, as well as a grey wedge on the inner web; the feet are
  flesh-coloured, <span class="pagenum" id="page307"><span class="smaller">{307}</span></span>the
  orbits yellowish. In winter the head is streaked, and in the young the plumage is mottled with
  brown. This species extends over Northern Europe and most of North America, ranging to the south
  of those countries in the cold season; its representative in the Mediterranean and Central Asia is
  <i>L. cachinnans</i>, with yellow feet and red orbits, and in Arctic Siberia <i>L. vegae</i>,
  chiefly differing from the last-named in its pinkish legs. <i>L. audouini</i> of the Western
  Mediterranean has blackish feet, and a crimson bill with black band. <i>L. canus</i>, the Common
  Gull, found throughout Northern Europe and Asia, and migrating to the Mediterranean, the Nile, the
  Persian Gulf, and China, has white mirrors on the first three primaries, yellow bill, and
  greenish-yellow feet. It has occurred in Labrador, and breeds in North Britain on islands, lakes,
  and flat stacks, though rarely, if ever, on cliff-faces; the shrill note is more like that of the
  Herring Gull than the harsh cry of our Black-backs. The smaller and darker <i>L.
  brachyrhynchus</i> occupies North-Western America, reaching California in winter; the paler <i>L.
  delawarensis</i>, with a subterminal black band on the yellowish bill, frequents lakes and marshes
  in North America, and breeds towards the north; <i>L. californicus</i>, with little black on the
  beak, inhabits western North America.</p>

  <p>Of the Black-backed Gulls, <i>L. marinus</i>, the Great Black-back, largest of the Family
  except <i>L. glaucus</i>, is found from Arctic Europe to North-East America, migrating as far as
  the Mediterranean, the Canaries, and Florida; it has a grey wedge on the primaries like the
  Herring Gull, and pinkish feet. Somewhat scarce in Britain in summer and comparatively
  non-gregarious, it is noted for its fierceness, and will even attack sheep. The smaller <i>L.
  dominicanus</i>, with olive feet, ranges from lat. 10&deg; S. in South America to South Africa and New
  Zealand, with the corresponding Antarctic Seas; <i>L. schistisagus</i> of the North Pacific being
  intermediate between this and the next species. <i>L. fuscus</i>, the Lesser Black-back, found
  both on our shores and inland, has yellow feet; its main range covers North Europe, excluding
  Iceland; but it even breeds in Morocco and on the Red Sea, extending in winter still further
  southwards. The similar <i>L. affinis</i> of North Russia and West Siberia, with coarser feet,
  migrates to Somaliland, India, and occasionally other districts; the very stout-billed <i>L.
  occidentalis</i> represents our species on the Pacific coast of North America.</p>

  <p>Mr. Saunders's next section contains five Gulls resembling <span class="pagenum"
  id="page308"><span class="smaller">{308}</span></span>the last group in having no hood and a white
  tail; but here the young have the head and tail-coverts unspotted. To this belong <i>L.
  bulleri</i> of New Zealand, the Chatham and Auckland Islands, with black bill and feet, which
  haunts inland rivers; and also four marine forms with crimson bill and feet. These are <i>L.
  scopulinus</i> of New Zealand, the Chatham and Auckland Islands; the larger <i>L. novae
  hollandiae</i> of Australia, Tasmania, and New Caledonia; the South African <i>L. hartlaubi</i>,
  found in Madagascar; and <i>L. gelastes</i>, ranging from North-West Africa and the Mediterranean
  to the Caspian and Sind, which lays its Tern-like eggs on sand-banks.</p>

  <p>The third section differs in having a subterminal black band on the tail, and, in the young, an
  irregularly striated hood. <i>L. crassirostris</i>, of the Chinese and Japanese Seas, has the base
  of the tail and the under parts white, the bill yellow, banded with red and black, the feet
  yellowish; <i>L. belcheri</i>, of Peru and Chili, has a blackish mantle and stouter beak; <i>L.
  heermani</i> of western North America has the tail black except for a white tip, a grey lower
  surface, red bill, and black feet; <i>L. modestus</i>, also of Peru and Chili, differing in its
  decidedly grey tail and black beak.</p>

  <p>The last-named is a connecting link with the fourth section, containing the Hooded Gulls; that
  is, those with hoods in mature plumage, but no marked hood in the young. Of these, all except the
  first three have the mantle grey and the head more or less white in winter; they are rather small
  birds, which chiefly inhabit the north, commonly breed in marshes, and utter a shrill querulous
  cry.</p>

  <p><i>L. fuliginosus</i> of the Gal&aacute;pagos, and <i>L. leucophthalmus</i> of the Red Sea and Gulf of
  Aden, are deep lead-coloured above with black head; but the former is grey below with no admixture
  of white, while the latter has a white nuchal collar, as has the much browner <i>L. hemprichi</i>,
  extending from East Africa to Bombay. <i>L. cirrocephalus</i> of Brazil, Argentina, and West and
  Central East Africa, which occurs in Peru and Natal, has a pale grey head; whereas a brown hood
  distinguishes <i>L. brunneicephalus</i> of Central&ndash;and in winter Southern&ndash;Asia, <i>L.
  maculipennis</i>, ranging from Brazil to Patagonia and Chili, <i>L. glaucodes</i> of Chili,
  Patagonia, and the Falklands, and <i>L. ridibundus</i>, the British Black-headed or Peewit Gull,
  which occupies Europe and temperate Asia, migrating to North Africa, India, and China. These four
  differ considerably in the pattern of the primaries,<a id="NtA_200"
  href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> <span class="pagenum" id="page309"><span
  class="smaller">{309}</span></span>but all have red bill and feet. The colonies of our
  marsh-breeding species supply large quantities of eggs for eating.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of the black-hooded, grey-mantled forms, which have as a rule red bill and feet, <i>L.
  atricilla</i>, the Laughing Gull, of the Atlantic coast of North America and Western Mexico, alone
  has black outer primaries; this species and <i>L. franklini</i>, of the interior of sub-Arctic
  America, having exceptionally dark mantles, and the latter pinkish under parts. Both migrate south
  in winter. <i>L. philadelphia</i>, Bonaparte's Gull, of all North America, which, like its two
  following congeners, strays to Britain, has the bill black; <i>L. melanocephalus</i>, of the
  Mediterranean and Black Seas, has a jet black head, a partly red bill, and nearly white quills;
  the very large <i>L. ichthya&euml;tus</i> ranging from the Black Sea and the Levant to Tibet, and
  wintering in Southern Asia, has the bill almost orange. <i>L. saundersi</i>, a slender-legged
  stout-billed bird, inhabits the rivers and coasts of China and Mongolia; <i>L. serranus</i> of the
  Andes from Ecuador to Chili being a near ally. <i>L. minutus</i>, the Little Gull, frequenting
  marshy districts in sub-Arctic and temperate <span class="pagenum" id="page310"><span
  class="smaller">{310}</span></span>Europe and Asia in summer, and reaching the Mediterranean in
  winter, is quite the smallest of the genus.</p>

  <p>The lovely <i>Rhodostethia rosea</i>, or Wedge-tailed Gull, of the North Polar seas, supposed
  to breed on islets north of Asia and America if not of Franz Josef Land, is easily distinguished
  by its small black bill, red feet, black collar, and rosy lower parts. One specimen is on record
  in Britain. <i>Xema sabinii</i>, or Sabine's Gull, which nests on maritime marshes from Greenland
  westward to the Taimyr Peninsula, wanders to Britain, France, the Bermudas, and Texas, and
  annually visits Peru; it may be recognised by its plumbeous head, black collar, and forked tail.
  Of the larger collarless <i>X. furcatum</i>, with a white basal band on the maxilla, the only five
  examples known are from the Gal&aacute;pagos and Peru.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Rhynchopinae.</i>&ndash;Of this group the curiously compressed beak and the
  habits have already been described (<span class="wnw">pp. <a href="#page301">301</a></span>, <a
  href="#page304">304</a>). The sole genus <i>Rhynchops</i>, or Scissor-bill, contains five species,
  of which <i>R. nigra</i> is black, with white forehead, cheeks, and lower parts; the wing-quills
  being also broadly tipped, and the tail-feathers varied, with white. The bill and feet are red,
  with a black end to the former. In winter the nape is whiter, while the young are buff and
  blackish above. Breeding from New Jersey to Florida, this bird strays to New Brunswick and
  migrates to Trinidad, occurring also in South-West Mexico. <i>R. intercedens</i> of South Brazil
  and Argentina, and the larger <i>R. melanura</i>, of the North and West of South America, have
  nearly uniform brown rectrices, but the latter has little white on the secondaries. <i>R.
  flavirostris</i>, extending from Senegal to Damara-Land, and from Egypt and the Red Sea to
  Nyassa-Land, has a red and orange beak; <i>R. albicollis</i>, of India and Lower Burma, differs
  from it in having the back of the neck white.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 4. <i>Sterninae.</i>&ndash;The Terns may be commenced with the snow-white <i>Gygis
  candida</i>, which ranges from the islands east of Brazil to Ascension, St. Helena, Madagascar and
  its vicinity, the Indian Ocean, the Malay countries, Australia, the Ladrones, the Sandwich Islands
  and Polynesia generally. The form and habits have been already noticed (<span class="wnw">pp. <a
  href="#page301">301</a></span>, <a href="#page303">303</a>). The smaller slender-billed <i>G.
  microrhyncha</i> seems to be peculiar to the Marquesas.</p>

  <p><i>Anous stolidus</i>, termed with its congeners the "Noddies" from their stolid indifference
  at times to man, chiefly frequents tropical and sub-tropical regions, and has occurred once in
  Ireland. It is <span class="pagenum" id="page311"><span
  class="smaller">{311}</span></span>sooty-brown, with whitish forehead, grey head, black bill and
  lores, and reddish-brown feet; <i>A. galapagensis</i> of the Gal&aacute;pagos being entirely sooty-black
  above. <i>A. (Micranous) leucocapillus</i>, with a weaker bill and a white crown, has a somewhat
  more restricted range; <i>A. (M.) tenuirostris</i>, with grey lores, ranges from the neighbourhood
  of Madagascar to Australia; <i>A. (M.) hawaiiensis</i>, with lighter upper parts, occurs around
  the Sandwich Islands. These species make a large flat nest of twigs, leaves, grass, and sea-weed,
  on trees, bushes, or even on the ground, laying one buffish-white egg with scattered red-brown
  markings. Several pairs often use one tree. <i>A. (Procelsterna) cinereus</i>, extending from
  Australia to Chili, and <i>A. (P.) caeruleus</i> of Central Polynesia, are nearly grey above, but
  the former is white beneath. The egg is ordinarily deposited with little or no nest on a bare rock
  or on sand.</p>

  <p>In all the rest of the Sub-family the tail is forked instead of graduated, though less markedly
  in <i>Naenia inca</i> of Peru and Chili, which is leaden-grey, with curling white plumes below the
  eye, red bill and feet.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Sterna</i> contains the more typical Terns or Sea-Swallows, of which the
  coloration&ndash;unless subsequently mentioned&ndash;is grey above, and white or lighter grey
  beneath and on the tail. <i>S. trudeaui</i> of Brazil, Argentina, and Chili, which strays to the
  United States, and <i>S. melanauchen</i>, ranging from the Amirante and Seychelles Islands to the
  Liu Kiu group and Polynesia, are the only two species with the crown white in place of black in
  the breeding season; the former bird has a black streak through the eye, the latter a band from
  the lores to the nape.</p>

  <p><i>S. minuta</i>, the Lesser Tern, breeds in many parts of Britain, and extends from about lat.
  60&deg; N. in Europe to the Mediterranean, the Caspian, and North India, migrating to South Africa,
  Burma, and Java. It has a white forehead and belly, black lores, orange feet, and yellow bill with
  black tip. The two or three whitish or drab eggs, marked with grey and black, differ strikingly
  from those of the Common Tern and its allies. The larger <i>S. sinensis</i> occurs from Bengal and
  Ceylon to Japan, New Guinea, and Australia; the greyer-rumped <i>S. antillarum</i>, the Least
  Tern, from northern South America to California and New England, or exceptionally to Labrador and
  West Africa; <i>S. saundersi</i>, with nearly black outer primaries, from East Africa to Burma.
  <i>S. superciliaris</i>, with yellow beak, is peculiar to eastern South <span class="pagenum"
  id="page312"><span class="smaller">{312}</span></span>America; <i>S. lorata</i>, with grey belly,
  to Peru and Chili; <i>S. nereis</i>, with white lores, to Australia, New Zealand, and New
  Caledonia; <i>S. balaenarum</i>, with black forehead and base of bill, to Southern Africa.</p>

  <p><i>S. fuliginosa</i>, <i>S. anaestheta</i>, and <i>S. lunata</i> are the Sooty Terns, so-called
  from their dark upper surface; the second being browner and the third greyer than the typical
  species, wherein alone the young differ from the adults in having brown lower parts instead of
  white. The forehead is white, the bill and feet are black, while immature birds show whitish
  markings above. These Terns frequent the tropics, but <i>S. lunata</i> only occurs from the
  Moluccas to Laysan, the Sandwich Islands, and elsewhere in Polynesia. <i>S. fuliginosa</i> has
  been obtained three times in England, occasionally on the Continent of Europe, and in America
  northwards to Maine. The single egg, like that of the Noddy, but with finer red, grey, and lilac
  markings, is laid on sand or flat rocks; descriptions of the colony, or "Wideawake Fair," on
  Ascension having been given by several writers.<a id="NtA_201" href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a>
  <i>S. aleutica</i> of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Japan, with a slate-grey mantle, white forehead and
  rump, connects the above with the next section.</p>

  <p>The remaining species, with white foreheads, are the large <i>S. bergii</i>, ranging from East
  and South-West Africa to Japan and Polynesia, excluding New Zealand, and <i>S. bernsteini</i> of
  the Seychelles, Rodriguez, Diego Garcia, and Halmahera, both of which have elongated nape-feathers
  and a yellowish bill, but grey and white rumps respectively. <i>S. frontalis</i>, of the New
  Zealand and Australian Seas, has a black bill.</p>

  <p>Of large forms, with black foreheads, black feet, and lengthened nuchal plumes, <i>S.
  cantiaca</i>, the Sandwich Tern, breeding from Britain and the Mediterranean to the Caspian, and
  from New England to Honduras and both coasts of Guatemala, possesses a black bill. It migrates to
  Cape Colony, Sind, and Brazil. The large <i>S. maxima</i>, and the similar but smaller <i>S.
  elegans</i>, have the beak red; the former extending from about lat. 40&deg; N. in America to Peru and
  Brazil, and in winter to West Africa; the latter from California to Chili. <i>S. eurygnatha</i>,
  found from Venezuela to Patagonia, only differs in its yellow bill; but <i>S. media</i>, ranging
  from the Mediterranean and East Africa to Australia, has the tail grey instead of white. In this
  section the richly marked eggs have often a creamy ground.</p>

  <p>One only of the smaller species allied to the last group has blackish bill and feet, namely
  <i>S. longipennis</i>,<a id="NtA_202" href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> occurring from Lake
  Baikal and Ceylon to Kamtschatka, Japan, and New Guinea. Of the remainder the Common, Arctic, and
  Roseate Terns breed in Britain, though the Roseate is decidedly scarce there. <i>S.
  fluviatilis</i>, the Common Tern, occupying the coasts and inland waters of Europe, temperate
  Asia, and temperate America&ndash;chiefly on the eastern side in the last case&ndash;and migrating
  to South Africa, India, Ceylon, and Brazil, has red feet, and red bill with horn-coloured tip, the
  lower parts being vinaceous grey. <i>S. macrura</i>, the Arctic Tern, frequenting the northern
  regions of Europe and America from lat. 82&deg; to 50&deg;, and 42&deg; N. respectively, has the bill entirely
  red, the metatarsus comparatively short, and the breast French grey. The two or three
  brown-spotted eggs vary from olive to green, and are frequently ruddier than those of the Common
  Tern. <i>S. dougalli</i>, the Roseate Tern, differing in the nearly black bill, the white tips to
  the inner webs of the primaries, and the evanescent pink tinge on the under parts, is widely
  distributed from lat. 57&deg; N. in the Atlantic to New Caledonia, but is apparently wanting in the
  Eastern Pacific. Its cry is peculiarly grating. <i>S. albigena</i>, ranging from the Red Sea to
  the Malabar coast, is much darker, and has orange feet; while <i>S. hirundinacea</i>, extending
  from Brazil and Peru to the regions south of Cape Horn, <i>S. vittata</i> of St. Paul's,
  Amsterdam, Inaccessible, Tristan da Cunha, and Kerguelen Islands, and <i>S. virgata</i> of
  Kerguelen Island and the Crozets are closely allied forms, of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page314"><span class="smaller">{314}</span></span>which the last two are said to lay a single
  egg. <i>S. albistriata</i>, with but slightly elongated outer rectrices, yellow bill and feet,
  inhabits New Zealand and strays to Norfolk Island; <i>S. forsteri</i>, with white under parts,
  orange bill, and reddish feet, inhabits most of North America. <i>S. melanogaster</i> of India,
  reaching northwards to Afghanistan and Bhutan, has a black belly.</p>

  <p>Of forms with much stouter bills than <i>Sterna</i>, <i>Seena aurantia</i>, of India, the
  Burmese countries and Yunnan, has the bill and feet orange; <i>Hydroprocne caspia</i>, the Caspian
  Tern&ndash;largest of the Sub-family&ndash;has a very short tail, red bill, and black feet. The
  latter occupies most of the world, except tropical South America and the Pacific Islands, visiting
  Britain, and breeding as near to it as Sylt. <i>Gelochelidon anglica</i>, the Gull-billed Tern,
  with a long metatarsus, reddish-black beak and feet, occurs in Britain and is found through the
  temperate and tropical parts of the Old and New Worlds, but not in South Africa, and rarely in
  Western America. <i>Pha&euml;thusa magnirostris</i>, of the warmer portions of North America, has a
  short tail, yellow bill, and olive-yellow feet.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Hydrochelidon</i>, or Marsh Tern, is distinguished by a short tail, a
  comparatively small bill, and feet with much indented webs. The note is shrill; the food consists
  of aquatic insects, varied by frogs, newts, and small fish: the nests, placed in close proximity
  on swamps or pools, are formed of water plants and are sometimes mere floating masses of them; the
  three eggs are often very dark olive or brown. <i>H. nigra</i>, the Black Tern or Blue Darr,
  ranges from Europe south of lat. 60&deg; N. and the Mediterranean to Turkestan, wintering as far as
  Loango and Abyssinia. It bred in the east of England up to 1858, since which date a nest is quite
  exceptional, while its two congeners are only chance visitors. The colour is lead-grey, with
  blacker head, black bill and reddish-brown feet. The darker race <i>H. surinamensis</i> inhabits
  temperate America from Alaska and Canada southwards, migrating to Chili and Brazil. <i>H.
  leucoptera</i>, the White-winged Black Tern, is found in Central and Southern Europe, temperate
  Asia and North Africa; reaching accidentally to America, and in winter from Cape Colony to
  Australia and New Zealand. It is chiefly black, with white carpal region, rump, tail, and vent,
  the bill and feet being red. <i>H. hybrida</i>, the Whiskered Tern, has a similar range, but
  breeds also from India to Australia. The main colour is slate-grey, the head and nape being black,
  the bill <span class="pagenum" id="page315"><span class="smaller">{315}</span></span>and feet red,
  and a white streak marking each cheek. In the winter and immature plumage the under parts are
  entirely, and the head partially white, throughout the genus.</p>

  <p>Of fossil Laridae <i>Halcyornis</i> occurs in the Lower Eocene of England, <i>Aegialornis</i><a
  id="NtA_203" href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> in the Upper Eocene of France; while the Lower
  Miocene of the latter country, the Middle Miocene of Germany, and the Pliocene of Oregon furnish
  <i>Larus</i>.</p>

  <p>Fam. VIII. <b>Alcidae.</b>&ndash;The Sub-order <span class="sc">Alcae</span> contains only this
  Family, or the Auks, wherein the body is heavy and compact, the head large, the plumage close and
  elastic. The stout bill varies extraordinarily, as will be seen under the various species. The
  abbreviated metatarsus is reticulated, usually with a row of scutellae in front; the long anterior
  toes are fully webbed, the hallux is absent or rudimentary, the claws are stout, acute, and
  slightly curved. The wings are very short, and the Great Auk was absolutely flightless; but most
  species fly strongly and rapidly to varying distances, the pinions not being flipper-like as in
  the Penguins, to which these birds have no affinity; like them, however, they commonly sit upright
  upon the metatarsus, and walk awkwardly from the feet being placed so far back, while they swim
  and dive to perfection. The primaries are eleven, the secondaries from fifteen to nineteen. The
  short tail may be rounded as in <i>Uria</i>, or graduated with pointed rectrices as in
  <i>Alca</i>; the quills numbering twelve, except in <i>A. impennis</i>, which has eighteen. The
  furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the syrinx tracheo-bronchial, the tongue
  lanceolate; the nostrils&ndash;covered with feathers in <i>Alca</i>, <i>Uria</i> and
  <i>Mergulus</i>, and with a horny membrane elsewhere&ndash;are pervious. An aftershaft is present,
  and down is plentiful on both adults and nestlings, being in the latter fluffy, and of a black,
  grey, or brown colour, sometimes relieved by white. Elongated feathers, crests, and horny
  outgrowths are common, as described below.</p>

  <p>Auks are entirely pelagic birds, breeding from the Polar Seas southwards to Japan, Lower
  California, Maine, and the Berlengas off the Tagus, while wandering further in winter; but the
  North Pacific may certainly be considered their headquarters. In the case of the British species a
  small proportion remain near shore after the autumn, but it seems to be quite uncertain where the
  majority spend the colder months. The members of this Family can hardly be called gregarious,
  except in the breeding time, <span class="pagenum" id="page316"><span
  class="smaller">{316}</span></span>when vast flocks arrive with great regularity, or even to an
  exact day. In England this occurs at the end of March or beginning of April, the latter part of
  August or the first week of September being as punctually observed for departure. Except for
  purposes of procreation, or during violent storms, individuals are rarely seen on land, as might
  be expected from the clumsy style of gait; yet Puffins and Black Guillemots are fairly good
  walkers, and the former fly particularly straight and swiftly. Auks either splash along the
  surface of the waves before diving, or plunge suddenly, and when immersed use their wings much as
  if flying. The usual voice is a harsh-toned croak or grunt, but in addition <i>Simorhynchus</i> is
  said to chatter, <i>Cyclorhynchus</i> to whistle; <i>Ptychorhamphus</i> utters a musical ringing
  sound, the Little Auk a wild cry, and Black Guillemots a shrill, plaintive note. Fish,
  crustaceans, worms, and the like, with chance ship-refuse, compose the diet; the birds frequently
  disgorging it when scared, and sometimes in order to feed the young.</p>

  <p>The great pear-shaped egg of the Guillemots proper, and the more oval one of the Razorbill, is
  deposited on some bare ledge of a cliff, on a stack, or on an island rock. In the case of the
  latter bird the egg is usually in a crevice, being white or buff with black or brown markings, and
  generally, if not invariably, green inside. Guillemots' eggs vary from white or buff to brilliant
  green or blue, and are spotted, streaked, or covered with intricate wavy patterns of black, brown,
  or rufous; the same bird probably always producing similar specimens. The Black Guillemots lay two
  greenish-white eggs with blotches of brown, rust-colour, and grey, under close-packed boulders or
  in holes low down in cliffs; that of the Little Auk is pale bluish-green, with or without faint
  rufous stains, and is found in similar, but commonly much higher, situations;
  <i>Synthliborhamphus</i> and various other forms use burrows in the turf, like Petrels, as an
  alternative to chinks in rocks; but the first-named produces two buff eggs, spotted with brown and
  grey, while the remainder lay only one, which is either white, or very indistinctly marked. Of
  these, Puffins fashion a considerable nest of dry materials. In some instances at least, both
  sexes incubate, the period being nearly five weeks. When hatched in holes the young remain there
  for a considerable time, otherwise they are soon assisted by their parents to reach the sea. Where
  unmolested, Auks are sufficiently tame; Puffins, <span class="pagenum" id="page317"><span
  class="smaller">{317}</span></span>Razorbills, and so forth, however, bite severely if handled,
  and the first-named will fight with each other to the death.</p>

  <p>As will be seen, the colour of both sexes in summer is black or dusky, varied by white, and
  occasionally brown; the winter plumage being duller and less decorative, and resembling the garb
  of the young. The size varies from that of the Great Auk to that of the Least or Knob-billed
  Auklet, the Family being confined to the Palaearctic and Nearctic Regions.</p>

  <p><i>Lunda cirrata</i>, the Tufted Puffin, ranging from South California to Japan, and straying
  to Eastern America, is sooty above and greyish below; the sides of the head being white
  anteriorly, a "rosette" of naked red skin adorning the gape, and a nuptial tuft of long
  straw-coloured feathers hanging from above each eye. The feet are red, and become flesh-coloured
  in winter. The highly compressed bill is red in front and yellowish behind; while its base
  consists of three portions, separated from each other and from the transversely grooved fore-part
  by furrows, which deepen until the pieces become detached and expose a soft brownish skin, that
  hardens again towards spring. <i>Fratercula arctica</i>, the Puffin, occupies in vast numbers many
  of the precipitous coasts and islands of Britain, laying its large, dull white, granulated
  egg&ndash;faintly marked with brown and speedily begrimed&ndash;in a rock-crevice, or a burrow,
  often made by the bird itself. The upper parts and gorget are black, the cheeks greyish, the lower
  surface white, the rosettes yellow, and the feet orange-red. The base of the huge compressed and
  grooved bill, blue, yellow, and red in colour, is shed in nine pieces towards winter, when the
  cheeks become white, the rosettes reddish, and a blunt, fleshy, horn-like appendage on the upper
  eyelid also disappears. This species breeds northwards in the Atlantic, from the Bay of Fundy and
  the Berlengas off the Tagus, and (as the larger form <i>F. glacialis</i>) eastwards to Novaya
  Zemlya, migrating a little further south: in the Pacific, <i>F. corniculata</i>, with longer horns
  and more developed deciduous bill-sheath, takes its place.</p>

  <p><i>Cerorhyncha monocerata</i>, the Rhinoceros Auklet of the North Pacific and western North
  America, has a stout, curved orange and black bill, with a large compressed horn between the
  nostrils, and an accessory piece on the mandible; the upper parts are dusky, the lower whitish
  with plumbeous cheeks and throat, while a row of narrow white feathers decorates each side of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page318"><span class="smaller">{318}</span></span>head. In winter the
  horny processes disappear, but not the plumes. <i>Ptychorhamphus aleuticus</i>, Cassin's Auklet,
  of the Pacific coast of North America, is black above and white below, with a lead-coloured
  throat, a white iris, and a bill which is mainly black, and becomes wrinkled in summer.
  <i>Cyclorhynchus psittaculus</i>, the Parrot Auk of the North Pacific, has an extraordinary
  compressed orange-red beak, to which the blunt decurved maxilla and narrow up-curved mandible give
  a rounded appearance; the upper parts and the throat are dusky; the lower surface, the iris, and a
  row of filaments behind each eye are white, as is the throat in winter. Three species of
  <i>Simorhynchus</i>, from the North Pacific, have a stout orange-red or purplish bill, a white
  iris, and black upper parts. <i>S. cristatellus</i>, the Crested Auklet, has several deciduous
  plates at the base of the beak, including a round piece at each side of the gape; the lower parts
  are grey; a tuft of dusky plumes curls over the forehead, and a line of narrow white feathers
  stretches across the ear-coverts&ndash;both being permanent: in winter the bill is horn-coloured.
  <i>S. pygmaeus</i>, the Whiskered Auklet, is without conspicuously deciduous plates, but has an
  additional patch of white plumes, reaching from the beak above and below the eye at all seasons.
  <i>S. pusillus</i>, the Least Auklet, has on the short maxilla a small compressed basal tubercle,
  which is shed in winter, but exhibits no crest. The scapular region shews a good deal of white;
  filamentous white feathers grace the forehead, lores, and ear-coverts; and dusky spots mark the
  lower parts, in summer only. <i>Synthliborhamphus antiquus</i>, of the Pacific north of Vancouver
  Island and Japan, but accidental elsewhere, has a short, compressed, yellow and black beak, with
  plumbeous upper and white lower parts; the head and throat are black with a white line on each
  side of the occiput, the upper back is streaked with white. In winter all the stripes vanish, and
  the throat is white. <i>S. wumizusume</i>, of the Eastern Asiatic seas southward to Japan, has a
  nuptial crest of long narrow plumes, but no streaks on the back. In the cold season the whole
  malar region and throat are white. <i>Brachyrhamphus marmoratus</i> of the North Pacific, reaching
  California in winter, has a small slender black bill, dusky upper parts barred with rufous, and
  white under parts varied with brown; <i>B. kittlitzi</i>, of the Aleutian Islands east to
  Unalashka, Kamtschatka, and North Japan, is thickly <span class="pagenum" id="page319"><span
  class="smaller">{319}</span></span>spotted with buff above; <i>B. hypoleucus</i> and <i>B.
  craveri</i> of Lower California are plain slate-coloured with white lower surface, the former
  having white and the latter grey wing-lining. The first two species have a white nuchal collar and
  irregular white markings above in winter, with nearly white lower parts.</p>

  <p><i>Cepphus grylle</i>, the Black Guillemot of the Atlantic northwards from Britain and Maine,
  and of the Arctic coasts of Europe, is black with a white wing-patch, the feathers of which are
  black at the base; in winter the plumage is white, relieved above and sometimes below by black,
  and the red feet become pinkish. The compressed pointed bill is always black. <i>C. mandti</i>,
  occupying, as it seems, the North Polar seas generally, and breeding as far south as Labrador, has
  a more slender bill, and no black wing-patch. <i>C. columba</i>, ranging from Bering Strait and
  Japan to California, has a large wedge-shaped black mark on the white wing-patch; <i>C. carbo</i>,
  of North-East Asia, Japan, the Kuril and Bering Islands, shews no white except round the eye. All
  these forms wander southwards in winter. The Black Guillemot or Tystie still breeds in the Isle of
  Man, and sparsely on the East of Scotland and Ireland, in the north and west of which countries it
  is not uncommon. It is remarkably tame when it breeds in the wilder districts, uttering a
  plaintive cry, and making its way to land in the face of an intruder. The two whitish or greenish
  eggs, beautifully spotted with black, brown, and grey, are deposited among large boulders, or in
  holes at the bases of cliffs, without any nest.</p>

  <p>Of the last group of Auks, with feathered nostrils, <i>Uria troile</i>, the well-known Common
  Guillemot, Willock, or Murre, breeds numerously in Britain, where the cliffs are suitable; it
  extends from Bear Island near Spitsbergen to the Magdalen Islands in America and the Tagus in
  Europe, occurring on migration southwards to the New England States and the Canaries. The plumage
  is dusky above and white below, with a brownish head and white alar bar. The throat, cheeks, and a
  few feathers on the head are white in winter; the long pointed bill and feet are blackish. The
  Ringed Guillemot is a mere variety with a white ring round the eye and a streak behind it; but
  <i>U. californica</i>, with stouter bill, from the Pacific coast of North America, may be
  considered a sub-species. <i>U. br&uuml;nnichi</i>, distinguishable by its blacker crown, and deeper
  beak with a white edge to the maxilla, <span class="pagenum" id="page320"><span
  class="smaller">{320}</span></span>ranges from the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Iceland to the Arctic
  Seas of both worlds in summer, moving further south in winter; the North Pacific race being
  denominated <i>U. arra</i>. Descriptions of the colonies of Guillemots in the icy seas, and of the
  smaller but equally crowded stations in Britain, have been too frequently given to need repetition
  here; but it may be mentioned that during incubation, which lasts about a month, the parent holds
  the egg between its thighs, and not unfrequently carries it off a ledge, when suddenly scared.  On
  flat-topped stacks these eggs (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page316">316</a></span>) often lie
  in the closest juxtaposition.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In <i>Alca</i> the black bill is deep and highly compressed, with a curved culmen; and shews
  oblique or transverse grooves, which are wanting in the young. <i>A. torda</i>, the Razorbill,
  less common in Britain than the Guillemot, ranges from Jan Mayen and Greenland to Maine and
  Brittany, visiting North Carolina and the Canaries in some winters. It is greenish-black with
  brown throat-region and white lower parts, a white line stretching from the top of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page321"><span class="smaller">{321}</span></span>beak to the eye, and another
  crossing both mandibles in the adult only. The tips of the secondaries are white, forming an alar
  bar, the feet are black. The throat and cheeks are white in the winter and immature plumage. <i>A.
  impennis</i>, the extinct Great Auk or Garefowl, inhabited the North Atlantic, chiefly in the
  neighbourhood of Iceland and Newfoundland, but apparently never reached north of the Arctic
  Circle. Remains have been found in the kitchen-middens of Denmark, North and West Scotland, and
  North and South Ireland; in a cave on the coast of Durham; and abundantly on Funk Island in the
  Newfoundland Seas, where the bird was called "Penguin"; that name being subsequently transferred
  to the Spheniscidae. The last two living examples were obtained at the isle of Eldey, off Iceland,
  in 1844, while 1812, 1821, and 1834 are the last dates of capture in Orkney, St. Kilda, and
  Ireland respectively, allowing for a possible instance in St. Kilda (Borrera) in 1840. This
  species, extirpated chiefly by the persecution of fishermen, but subsequently by collectors,
  resembled a flightless Razorbill, though double the size; it had no white stripes on the head or
  bill, but shewed a large white patch before each eye. The huge egg was white or buff, with
  scattered round spots or plentiful fine scrawls of black or brown; about seventy of these eggs,
  and a somewhat greater number of birds, existing at present in collections.<a id="NtA_204"
  href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Mergulus alle</i>, the Little Auk or Rotche, occurring on migration in Britain, and
  occasionally in the Canaries, Azores, and New Jersey, breeds from Greenland and the Kara Sea to
  North Iceland. It is black above and white below, with a spot over the eye, streaks on the
  scapulars, and an alar bar also of white; the throat is black in summer only. The short, broad,
  arched bill is black, the feet are brownish. The single greenish- or bluish-white egg, often
  shewing faint rufous markings, is deposited in a deep crevice of a cliff, or among boulders on
  beaches.</p>

  <p>As regards fossil forms, <i>Uria</i> has been found in the Miocene of Maine and North Carolina,
  and in the Pliocene of Tuscany.</p>

  <p>Of the second or Pteroclo-Columbine group of Charadriiform Birds (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page268">268</a></span>) the Old World Sub-Order <span class="sc">Pterocles</span> contains
  only&ndash;</p>

  <p>Fam. IX. <b>Pteroclidae</b>, or the Sand-Grouse, equally interesting as regards their structure
  and their habits. Originally considered <span class="pagenum" id="page322"><span
  class="smaller">{322}</span></span>akin to Grouse, they have since given rise to much discussion;
  Dr. Gadow's view&ndash;here adopted&ndash;being that they are highly specialized forms, analogous
  to the Galli in their digestive organs, but homologically constituting a link between the
  Limicolae and the Columbae.<a id="NtA_205" href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> From the Pigeons
  they certainly differ remarkably in the condition of the chicks, which are covered with brown,
  creamy, and black down, and run almost immediately from the shell; yet they agree with them in
  most points of osteology, myology, and pterylosis, while the eggs recall those of Rails, and the
  flight resembles that of a Plover.</p>

  <p>The body is compact; the bill short, arched, and fairly stout; the metatarsus abbreviated and
  feathered anteriorly, or entirely in <i>Syrrhaptes</i>. In this genus, moreover, the hallux, much
  reduced elsewhere, is totally absent; and the short front toes are enclosed in a sort of casing,
  which is covered as far as the thick claws with hairy plumage, the whole forming a padded foot
  unique among Birds. The long pointed wings have sixteen or seventeen secondaries, and eleven
  primaries, of which the outer has its shaft produced into a thin filament in <i>Syrrhaptes
  paradoxus</i>; the wedge-shaped tail has sixteen rectrices, the median pair being elongated and
  pointed in that genus and <i>Pteroclurus</i> (Pin-tailed Sand-Grouse), if the latter be allowed to
  stand. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the syrinx tracheo-bronchial, the
  tongue lanceolate; there is a small aftershaft, and a large crop; while the down of the adults is
  sparingly distributed.</p>

  <p>Sand-Grouse are true desert-birds, affording excellent instances of protective coloration in
  their buff or brownish tints, slightly varied with grey, black, orange, and white; <i>Pterocles
  fasciatus</i> and <i>P. lichtensteini</i>, however, prefer bushy and rocky ground to bare, sandy,
  or stony plains. Gregarious yet monogamous, they are shy and wary, but very pugnacious among
  themselves; their flight is swift, strong, and noisy; their powers of walking and running good,
  though rather clumsy, owing to the extremely short legs. All the species lie closely until
  flushed, and are fond of basking in the sun on their sides, in holes scraped out for the purpose.
  Migration probably prevails to some extent throughout the Family, while the irruptions of
  <i>Syrrhaptes paradoxus</i> into Europe (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page324">324</a></span>)
  are quite unparalleled. The cry, often uttered upon the wing, is a piercing whistle, or a
  twittering <span class="pagenum" id="page323"><span class="smaller">{323}</span></span>or clucking
  sound; though that of <i>Syrrhaptes</i> appears to be hoarser, and has been syllabled as
  "truck-turuck" and "caga-caga" in <i>S. paradoxus</i> and <i>S. tibetanus</i> respectively. The
  alarm-note is of a croaking nature. The food consists of seeds, tender shoots, bulbous
  grass-roots, and insects, or even of berries, peas, and beans; while the birds flock to drink at
  certain favourite spots, and are variously stated to take continuous or interrupted draughts. The
  nest is a mere hollow in the soil, frequently lined with a little grass; the three oval, but
  peculiarly cylindrical, eggs vary from whitish to buff, or greenish in <i>Syrrhaptes</i>, and are
  marked with brown, reddish, and violet. Both sexes assist in incubation, which lasts from
  twenty-five to twenty-eight days. Opinions vary as to the edible quality of the flesh.</p>

  <p><i>Pterocles arenarius</i>, ranging from the Canary Islands, North Africa, and Madagascar to
  South Europe and Central Asia, has dark grey upper parts, with orange-yellow markings, except on
  the white-tipped primaries and tail; the chestnut throat surmounts a black patch, which is
  succeeded by a breast of the same dove-colour as the head, crossed by a black band; the belly
  being black also. The bill is horn-coloured, the feet are greyish. The female is buff, barred
  above and spotted below with black; her throat is yellowish-white, and the black areas on her
  lower surface are as in the male. <i>P. decoratus</i> of East Africa, <i>P. bicinctus</i> and
  <i>P. variegatus</i> of South Africa, <i>P. coronatus</i> and <i>P. lichtensteini</i>, extending
  from the Sahara and Kordofan respectively to North-West India, <i>P. gutturalis</i> of East
  Africa, <i>P. personatus</i> of Madagascar, <i>P. fasciatus</i> of India&ndash;the only species
  peculiar to Asia&ndash;and <i>P. quadricinctus</i>, found from Senegambia to Abyssinia, are fairly
  similar to the above, though chiefly sandy in some cases.</p>

  <p><i>Pteroclurus alchata</i>, absurdly termed "Perdrix d'Angleterre" <span class="pagenum"
  id="page324"><span class="smaller">{324}</span></span>in France, and Rock-Pigeon in India, is grey
  above, with yellow tips to the dorsal feathers; it has black, brown, and greyish-white wings,
  shewing chestnut and yellow on the coverts; yellowish rump and long median rectrices barred with
  black. The cheeks are orange, the throat is black with a little yellow beneath, the upper breast
  is chestnut-red, bordered by a black line above and below, the remaining under parts are white,
  the bill and feet brownish. The female differs in her white throat, and in her upper surface
  irregularly marked with buff, grey, and black. This species occurs in South Europe, North Africa,
  and South-West Asia; <i>P. namaqua</i> inhabits South Africa; <i>P. exustus</i> ranges from
  Senegal to the Pangani River in East Africa, and through Palestine to Central Asia and India;
  while <i>P. senegallus</i> extends from the Sahara to Palestine, Arabia, and North-West India.</p>

  <p><i>Syrrhaptes paradoxus</i>, Pallas's Sand-Grouse, has buff upper parts barred with black;
  mainly blue-grey wings and tail, with black and chestnut markings on the former, and white tips to
  the lateral rectrices; dull yellow crown and cheeks; orange nape and throat; greyish-buff neck and
  breast, white abdomen and metatarsal plumage, an interrupted black gorget, and a broader black
  band towards the belly. The female has less elongated median tail-feathers, black streaks on the
  buff head, a black bar across the throat, and is duller generally. <i>S. tibetanus</i>, with
  entirely white belly, the largest of the Family, extends from the Sutlej and South Kashmir to
  Koko-Nor; but its congener reaches from the Lower Volga or the Kirghiz Steppes to the north of
  Lake Baikal and North China, while some erratic impulse of uncertain origin causes it to invade
  the plains of China and the whole of Europe at irregular intervals. One specimen was obtained at
  Sarepta on the Volga in 1848, and again in 1860, when flocks visited Pekin; in 1859 a few examples
  occurred on the Continent, and between July and November three wandered to Britain; while in 1863
  some 700 individuals reached our shores by May 21, straying as far as Ireland, but vanishing
  towards autumn. Several pairs bred on the sand-hills of Holland and Jutland. In 1872 and 1876
  small parties visited us; and in 1888 another and incalculably larger invasion took place, which
  extended farther southward than that of 1863, and after entering Europe before the beginning of
  April, occupied Britain between May 6 and May 15, to remain there throughout <span class="pagenum"
  id="page325"><span class="smaller">{325}</span></span>that year and the succeeding. Besides
  breeding in Denmark, Holstein, and no doubt elsewhere on the Continent, two pairs nested in 1888
  in the east of Yorkshire, and one or more on the Culbin Sands in Moray, whence in 1889 Professor
  Newton received on August 8 a chick of two or three days old. This was exhibited at the Newcastle
  Meeting of the British Association, and subsequently figured in <i>The Ibis</i>.<a id="NtA_206"
  href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> Doubtless the above were not the only cases of reproduction in
  England, and it was hoped that a protective Act, which came into force in February 1889, would
  lead to permanent colonization; but by 1890, or, according to some, 1892, all the birds had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>As a fossil, <i>Pterocles</i> occurs in the Eocene and Miocene of France.</p>

  <p>The Sub-Order <span class="sc">Columbae</span> must certainly be divided into the Families
  <i>Dididae</i> for the Dodo and Solitaire, and <i>Columbidae</i> for the Pigeons, while a third,
  <i>Didunculidae</i>, may be added to contain the Tooth-billed Pigeon of Samoa, to which
  <i>Otidiphaps</i> of Papuasia is possibly allied. For convenience sake we may accept four
  Sub-families of the <i>Columbidae</i>, namely (1) <i>Gourinae</i>, (2) <i>Peristerinae</i>, (3)
  <i>Columbinae</i>, and (4) <i>Treroninae</i>, though the arrangement is somewhat arbitrary. Dr.
  Gadow<a id="NtA_207" href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> segregates <i>Caloenatinae</i>, but not
  <i>Peristerinae</i>, while he and Count Salvadori<a id="NtA_208"
  href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> agree in considering <i>Didunculus</i> merely on a level with
  these subdivisions.</p>

  <p>Throughout the group the body is compact, while the bill varies from stout to slender, being
  swollen and hardened at the decurved tip, which forms a hook in the Dididae and Didunculidae. The
  base of this feature is covered with a soft skin or cere, containing the nostrils;
  <i>Globicera</i>, <i>Vinago calva</i>, and <i>Ptilopus insolitus</i> have a fleshy or bony knob at
  the posterior part of the culmen, said to be most prominent in the breeding season; and
  <i>Didunculus</i> has the mandible toothed and truncated. The metatarsi, reticulated in the
  Gourinae, but scutellated elsewhere, are usually partly feathered, especially in Fruit-Pigeons;
  some species of <i>Columbigallina</i>, however, have them naked; <i>Drepanoptila</i> has them
  entirely covered; and in many domestic breeds the plumage extends over the toes, which are all on
  the same level, and possess moderate claws. The skin is more or less expanded <span
  class="pagenum" id="page326"><span class="smaller">{326}</span></span>on each side of the digits.
  The rounded wings are commonly long, but are short in Ground-Pigeons, and aborted in the
  flightless Dididae, the primaries numbering eleven and the secondaries from ten to seventeen; the
  former are bifurcated at the tip in <i>Drepanoptila</i>, attenuated in some members of
  <i>Ptilopus</i>, <i>Oxypelia</i>, <i>Peristera</i>, and <i>Leptoptila</i>, while one or more of
  the three outer feathers is not uncommonly scalloped. The tail varies considerably in form and
  dimensions, being wedge-shaped in <i>Sphenocercus</i>, rounded in <i>Zenaida</i>,
  <i>Phabotreron</i>, and <i>Megaloprepia</i>, acuminate in <i>Ectopistes</i>, long and graduated in
  <i>Oena</i>, <i>Macropygia</i>, and <i>Reinwardtoenas</i>, and so forth. The rectrices range from
  twelve to twenty, sixteen being the normal number in the Gourinae, twelve in the Columbinae, and
  fourteen in the Treroninae. The neck-feathers may be bifurcated, as in <i>Alectoroenas</i>,
  <i>Columba guinea</i>, and occasionally in <i>Turtur</i>, or those of the breast, as in some
  species of <i>Macropygia</i>, <i>Ptilopus</i>, and <i>Phaenorrhina</i>; the neck, moreover, is
  hackled in <i>Caloenas</i> and <i>Lopholaemus</i>, and the body-plumage is generally narrow with
  widely-separated barbs in <i>Chrysoenas</i>. Five members of <i>Phlogoenas</i> have a patch of
  stiff feathers over the crop; while the splendid decomposed crest of <i>Goura</i> is exceptionally
  striking, and more ordinary tufts grace the head in <i>Lopholaemus</i>, <i>Coryphoenas</i>,
  <i>Lophophaps</i>, <i>Ocyphaps</i>, and elsewhere. The forehead is sometimes nearly bare, as are
  the lores and eyelids in <i>Gymnophaps</i>; naked red or yellow orbits are found in
  <i>Gymnopelia</i>, <i>Reinwardtoenas</i>, <i>Macropygia</i>, <i>Turacoena</i>, <i>Didunculus</i>,
  and <i>Columba gymnophthalma</i>, not to mention other instances; while the tendency reaches its
  height in the huge circumocular wattles of several fanciers' races. In <i>Serresius</i> a
  feathered "saddle" extends over half the culmen.</p>

  <p>The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, being much reduced in the Dididae; the
  syrinx is remarkable for the asymmetrical union of the sterno-tracheal muscles; the tongue is
  lanceolate; the impervious nostrils are linear in the Columbidae and Didunculidae, oblique in the
  Dididae. The crop is more highly developed than in other Families. The gizzard of <i>Caloenas</i>
  is remarkable for an indurated horn-like patch on each side of the epithelial lining, that of
  <i>Carpophaga latrans</i> has the interior beset with similar conical prominences, correlated with
  a diet of hard fruit. <i>Phaenorrhina</i> has these cones still more developed, and
  <i>Ptilopus</i> agrees with <i>Drepanoptila</i> in possessing four pads in the above organ instead
  <span class="pagenum" id="page327"><span class="smaller">{327}</span></span>of two, the regular
  number in Birds. The after-shaft is rudimentary or absent, the adults have no down, the young are
  hatched blind and naked, and remain for a long time in the nest. The plumage is commonly dull blue
  or brown, with an iridescent sheen; but remarkably brilliant purple, red, yellow, and green hues
  manifest themselves in forms such as <i>Ptilopus</i>, <i>Chrysoenas</i>, and <i>Caloenas</i> from
  the islands of the Eastern Seas, the headquarters of the Family. Though smaller, the female
  usually resembles the male; but <i>Turturoena</i>, <i>Oena</i>, and <i>Peristera</i> are examples
  of diversity, while immature examples are duller than adults. <i>Goura</i> approaches the size of
  a goose, whereas <i>Columbigallina</i> is little larger than a sparrow. Of domestic Pigeons the
  Rock-Dove is undoubtedly the origin, but the breeds are now infinite in their variety.<a
  id="NtA_209" href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Omitting the abnormal Didine Birds, the habits of the members of this group are fairly uniform,
  the majority of them inhabiting wooded country; while even those like <i>Phaps</i>,
  <i>Lophophaps</i>, and <i>Geophaps</i>, which occupy the arid plains of Australia, are to be found
  at times where vegetation is plentiful; and in all cases the proximity of water seems
  indispensable. Fruit-Pigeons frequent trees, and the most typical Columbine forms are found in
  woods or among rocks, though the smaller Doves naturally prefer the lower bushes. Wood-Pigeons
  towards winter, and Passenger-Pigeons when nesting&ndash;not to mention other
  instances&ndash;gather in large flocks; in some cases, however, the parties only number about half
  a dozen, and more solitary habits are by no means uncommon. The flight is strong, rapid, and
  direct, though the Ground-Pigeons remain a comparatively short time upon the wing, and some
  species prefer to run unless forced to rise, <i>Oena</i> being an especially good walker. The
  well-known "homing" powers of trained birds, the curious backward somersaults of the Tumbler, and
  the sudden rise and clap of the wings so noticeable in the Wood-Pigeon when courting, merit a
  passing mention. Every member of the Family perches, and many delight to bask in the sun. The note
  is always of the nature of a coo, but is especially loud and deep in <i>Myristicivora</i>,
  <i>Megaloprepia</i>, and some members of <i>Carpophaga</i>, guttural in <i>Haplopelia</i>,
  mournful in <i>Peristera</i> and <i>Zenaidura</i>, harsh and trumpet-like in <i>Goura</i>; the
  voice of the Turtle-Dove suggests a purr, while <i>Tympanistria</i> and <i>Starnoenas</i> possess
  powers of ventriloquism. <span class="pagenum" id="page328"><span
  class="smaller">{328}</span></span>The food of the Wood-Pigeon is grain, beech-mast, acorns,
  turnips, and tender shoots of plants; that of Fruit-Pigeons consists of figs, palm-nuts, grapes,
  and so forth, plucked from the tree, and in the case of <i>Myristicivora bicolor</i> and
  <i>Globicera myristicivora</i>, largely of the mace which encases the nutmeg; Ground-Doves and
  other small forms subsist mainly on seeds of grasses; and it may be safely inferred that in most
  cases the diet varies considerably. <i>Turturoena</i> is stated to eat Cicada larvae;
  <i>Leucosarcia</i> those of Diptera; <i>Goura</i> and <i>Otidiphaps</i> worms, snails, and
  insects. Pigeons, unlike birds generally, take continuous draughts of water, immersing the bill to
  the base. The nest is usually a slight platform of sticks, placed aloft on a branch or in a bush;
  but our Rock-Dove and <i>Columba phaeonota</i> of South Africa breed in caves or holes in rocks;
  the Stock-Dove prefers hollow trees, rabbit-burrows, and the like; <i>Geophaps</i> the bare soil;
  and so forth. <i>Phaps</i>, <i>Peristera</i>, and <i>Zenaida</i> nest either on the ground or in
  bushes, but the latter appear to be almost invariably chosen by Ground-Doves like
  <i>Columbigallina</i> and <i>Geopelia</i>. The white eggs are two, or exceptionally three, in
  number; the Dodo, however, laid only one, and so do <i>Caloenas</i>, <i>Ectopistes</i>,
  <i>Didunculus</i>, and some species of <i>Carpophaga</i> and <i>Columba</i>, as well as
  <i>Goura</i>, where it is larger than that of a tame Duck. Societies, such as those of
  <i>Ectopistes</i> and <i>Caloenas</i>, are most unusual. Some Pigeons breed three times a year,
  the male commonly assisting in incubation, which lasts from fourteen to twenty-eight days. The
  members of this Family are shy, but readily tamed; yet the Collared Turtle-Dove is perhaps the
  only really good cage-bird. Most of them are excellent for the table, <i>Leucosarcia</i>,
  <i>Geophaps</i>, <i>Goura</i>, and the Treroninae being accounted particularly delicate, while the
  Wood-Pigeon and the domestic breeds speak for themselves. The great damage, however, done to
  crops, such as turnips, peas, or barley, by the flocks counterbalances their economic value to a
  considerable extent, the most typical forms being undoubtedly the worst offenders.</p>

  <p>Fam. X. <b>Dididae.</b>&ndash;This consists of three extinct species&ndash;<i>Didus
  ineptus</i>, the Dodo of Mauritius, <i>D. borbonicus</i> of R&eacute;union (Bourbon), and <i>Pezophaps
  solitarius</i>, the Solitaire of Rodriguez.</p>

  <p>The Dodo, familiar to all by name, if not by pictures, was an immense Pigeon-like bird bigger
  than a Turkey, with an aborted keel to the sternum and the wings also aborted. The coracoid and
  scapula met at an obtuse angle, as in many other flightless species. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page329"><span class="smaller">{329}</span></span>The huge blackish bill terminated in a large
  horny hook, the cheeks were partly bare, the short yellow legs were stout, scaly, and feathered on
  the upper portion; the plumage was dark ash-coloured, with whitish breast and tail,
  yellowish-white wings, and black tips to their coverts. The short rectrices formed a curled tuft,
  and the first four primaries were directed backwards.</p>

      Savery's Vienna picture.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This uncouth and unwieldy species, of which a full account will be found in the works mentioned
  below,<a id="NtA_210" href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> which have been largely utilized here,
  was noticed as early as 1598 by the Dutch, who called it Walghvogel, or Nauseous Bird, from their
  dislike of its flesh, and the island, where it was then found abundantly, Mauritius. The earliest
  representation was given in 1601 by De Bry, who stated that an example was brought alive to
  Holland. Other Dutch fleets subsequently visited the island, and several sketches of the Dodo were
  made, while one of the captains records that it was indifferently called Dodaars or Dronte.
  Roelandt Savery of Courtrai (1576-1639) painted the Dodo&ndash;probably from life&ndash;more than
  once, pictures by him still existing in <span class="pagenum" id="page330"><span
  class="smaller">{330}</span></span>Berlin (1626), Vienna (1628), the Hague, Pommersfelden,
  Stuttgart, and London, the last-named belonging to the Zoological Society. The British Museum also
  possesses an undated picture, another is at Haarlem, a third at Oxford; while one by Goiemare at
  Sion House (dated 1627), and one said to be by Hoefnagel in the library of the late Emperor of
  Austria (<i>circa</i> 1620) were possibly taken from living birds. In 1628 Englishmen appeared on
  the scene, Emanuel Altham having sent a specimen home alive to his brother, while Herbert,
  accompanying the same fleet, mentioned the Dodo and figured it. About 1634 an example was given to
  the Anatomy School at Oxford by a Mr. Gosling, and some four years later Sir Hamon Lestrange saw a
  captive bird in London. Finally, we may note that individuals existed in Mauritius until 1681, as
  proved by the journal of Benjamin Harry.</p>

  <p>In 1865 the discovery of a large quantity of remains in the Mare aux Songes, by Mr. G. Clark,
  enabled Owen and others to confirm the suggestion of the Danish naturalist, Reinhardt, of the
  Dodo's affinity to the Pigeons; while in 1889 M. Sauzier, acting for the Government of Mauritius,
  sent to the late Sir Edward Newton a series of bones from the same spot, enabling the first
  correctly restored and properly mounted skeleton to be returned for the museum of that island, and
  the important paper, noticed above, to be published by the last-named and Dr. Gadow. Nearly
  perfect specimens exist at Cambridge, in the British Museum, and at Paris.</p>

  <p>The Dodo is said to have inhabited forests, to have swallowed pebbles, to have uttered a cry
  like that of a gosling, and to have laid one large white egg on a mass of grass. Hogs and other
  imported animals seem to have conduced to its extermination, as well as the hand of man.</p>

  <p><i>Didus borbonicus</i> had white plumage, varied with yellow, the first four primaries being
  directed forwards and downwards. It is mentioned by Tatton (1625), Du Bois (1669), and Carr&eacute;
  (1699); while Bontekoe (1646) gave a figure apparently intended to represent it, and another by
  Pierre Witthoos (<i>ob.</i> 1693) was in existence a few years ago. It was originally called the
  Solitaire, but this name was also applied to <i>Pezophaps solitarius</i> of Rodriguez by the
  Huguenot exile Leguat, who described and figured the latter about 1691. <i>Pezophaps</i> was
  subsequently briefly noticed by D'Heguerty (1751) and again by Pingr&eacute; (1761), who heard <span
  class="pagenum" id="page331"><span class="smaller">{331}</span></span>that it still existed in
  inaccessible districts; while it is also mentioned in an anonymous manuscript discovered at Paris,
  written perhaps about 1729. Remains came into the hands of Desjardins in 1789 (not fully
  recognised until 1832), and others were forwarded to England; but much the most important finds
  were those of the late Sir Edward Newton in 1864, followed up by Mr. Jenner in the succeeding
  years, and of Mr. H. H. Slater in 1874.<a id="NtA_211" href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> In 1875
  two complete skeletons were obtained, and fairly perfect specimens of those of each sex are at
  Cambridge, with others elsewhere.</p>

  <p>This Solitaire was larger than a Swan, the male standing about 2 feet 9 inches, and the female
  2 feet 3 inches high; the colour of the former was brownish-grey, but the latter varied from the
  hue of "fair hair" to brown, and had a whitish breast. The slightly-hooked, elongated beak had a
  feathered ridge or peak at the base of the culmen, the neck was elongated and straight, the legs
  were longer and weaker than in the Dodo, the wings were rudimentary, the hind part (pelvis) was
  rounded, the tail was hardly noticeable, and the thigh-feathers were thick, and curved like shells
  at the end. A spherical mass of bone, "as big as a musket-ball," was developed on the wings of the
  males; and they used it, in addition to the beak, as a weapon of offence, while they whirled
  themselves about twenty or thirty times in four or five minutes, making a noise with their pinions
  like a rattle. The mien was fine and the walk stately, the birds being seen singly or in pairs;
  the nest was a heap of palm-leaves a foot or more high, the single large egg was incubated by both
  parents. The food is said to have consisted of seeds and leaves, and a stone as big as a hen's egg
  was often found in the stomach.</p>

  <p>Fam. XI. <b>Didunculidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Didunculus strigirostris</i>, the Manu-me&agrave; or Red Bird
  of the islands of Upolu, Savai, and Tutuila in the Samoan group, is glossy greenish-black, with
  chestnut back, rump, wing-coverts, tail and under tail-coverts, but browner wing-quills and
  abdomen. The hooked and toothed bill is orange, the feet are reddish, and the naked orbits red.
  The sexes are similar, the young entirely brown. First made known by Strickland on the strength of
  its discovery in the autumn of 1839 by Peale <span class="pagenum" id="page332"><span
  class="smaller">{332}</span></span>during the United States Exploring Expedition under Commander
  Wilkes, it has since been met with by several travellers and missionaries, three living specimens
  having been exhibited in the Gardens of the Zoological Society of London. By 1863 it was regarded
  as nearly extinct on Upolu, where it was formerly abundant, though it still held its own on Savai;
  but in 1874 an increase was reported from the latter island, which was attributed to a change of
  habits, the birds having become arboreal instead of terrestrial.</p>

      <i>Didunculus strigirostris.</i> &times; &frac14;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The oldest accounts, derived from native sources, stated that <i>Didunculus</i> was essentially
  a ground species, living on thickly-wooded mountain-sides in flocks of about a dozen, and feeding
  on berries, plantains (bananas), and yam fruit, while it roosted on low stumps, and bred on the
  ground, being rather shy, and taking to flight noisily with much flapping of the wings. Mr.
  Whitmee<a id="NtA_212" href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> and others, however, tell us that it
  now feeds almost exclusively on high trees, roosting aloft, and building in the forks. But as
  early as 1852 Lieutenant Walpole<a id="NtA_213" href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> asserted that
  the bird bred among rocks, perched and fed on trees, and flew from wood to wood, or even from
  island to island, so that it is not impossible that its supposed affinity to the Dodo led writers
  astray, and that its fondness for the ground was greatly exaggerated. No doubt danger from
  introduced cats and rats would force the nest to be placed higher.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page333"><span class="smaller">{333}</span></span></div>

  <p>The Tooth-billed Pigeon was usually found in pairs or small parties, and was in great request
  for food among the natives, who, moreover, kept individuals tethered to sticks as pets, while the
  chiefs erected small huts in which to feed the flocks. They were often attracted by decoys, and
  caught with bird-lime. The habits are diurnal, or somewhat crepuscular; the note apparently varies
  from deep and guttural to low and plaintive; and breeding takes place from May to September, the
  single egg being white. The birds are decidedly pugnacious in captivity, and occasionally nibble
  their food in Parrot fashion.</p>

  <p>Fam. XII. <b>Columbidae.</b>&ndash;If we omit the Arctic and Antarctic countries, this group
  forms a remarkably cosmopolitan Family, though with an irregular distribution. Roughly speaking,
  there are recognised some dozen Palaearctic, and still fewer Nearctic species, with about seventy
  Neotropical and forty Ethiopian; India possesses about thirty, the Malay Archipelago perhaps a
  hundred and twenty, New Guinea and the Moluccas a hundred. Many island forms occur in Polynesia,
  but Australia can barely claim twenty, the New Zealand seas only furnish two, and the Sandwich
  Islands none.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page334"><span class="smaller">{334}</span></span></div>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Gourinae.</i>&ndash;This contains seven species of <i>Goura</i>&ndash;<i>G.
  coronata</i> of Western New Guinea, Waigiou, Batanta, Salawatti, and Mysol, <i>G. cinerea</i> of
  the Arfak Mountains, <i>G. sclateri</i> of Central and Southern New Guinea, <i>G. albertisi</i> of
  South-East New Guinea, <i>G. scheepmakeri</i>, probably from South-West New Guinea&ndash;all of
  which have the erect crest-feathers with entirely decomposed webs&ndash;<i>G. victoria</i> of Jobi
  and Mysori, and <i>G. beccarii</i> of Central and North New Guinea&ndash;which have them with
  spatulate tips. The first of these, discovered by Dampier in 1699, is bluish-slate-coloured, with
  darker wings, and some black on the chin and sides of the head; a broad chestnut band crossing the
  back, one of white shewing conspicuously on the wing, and one of grey terminating the tail. The
  other species differ in the amount of chestnut above, the wing-bar being grey and the breast
  chestnut in some cases. These birds are found near open or cultivated lands, ranging from the
  coast regions to an altitude of a thousand feet; they feed in small flocks, and eat seeds,
  berries, and other fruits, buds of plants, worms, and insects. The usual note is long, harsh, and
  trumpet-like, the love-call a short mournful coo. When disturbed they take to cover, and pitch
  upon low branches, where they also roost; in the heat of the day they lie in the shade with
  outspread wings and tail; and in the courting-season the cocks fight savagely for the hens. The
  nest, a careless platform of sticks, contains one large white egg.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Peristerinae.</i>&ndash;This ranges over both the Old and the New World,
  <i>Zenaida</i>, <i>Peristera</i>, and their closest allies being confined to the latter, while
  <i>Turtur</i>, <i>Phaps</i>, and so forth belong to the former.</p>

  <p>Group (<i>a</i>).&ndash;<i>Caloenas nicobarica</i>, which extends from the Nicobar Islands
  through the Malay Archipelago to the Solomons, is a metallic-green bird, with bronzy reflexions
  and blackish head, neck, and upper breast, most of the remiges being black, and the tail with its
  coverts white. The long narrow neck-hackles, the roughly-scaled legs, and the black knob at the
  base of the bill are also remarkable features. Partly but not entirely terrestrial, it walks at a
  great rate, feeds mainly upon the ground on seeds, utters a croaking note, often builds in
  societies on trees, and lays one white egg. <i>C. pelewensis</i>, of the Pelew Islands, is smaller
  and bluer.</p>

  <p>Group (<i>b</i>).&ndash;This section of the Sub-family contains several robust forms, with
  fairly long, stout legs, and short, rounded wings. <span class="pagenum" id="page335"><span
  class="smaller">{335}</span></span><i>Otidiphaps nobilis</i> of Western New Guinea and Batanta,
  <i>O. cervicalis</i> of South-East New Guinea, and <i>O. insularis</i> of Fergusson Island, are
  greenish-black, chestnut, and purple, with the bill red, the feet reddish with rough yellow
  scales, and the nape green, grey, and black respectively. They have no less than twenty rectrices,
  while the first two have an occipital crest. These Pigeons, said to resemble Megapodes in habits,
  frequent hills or dense thickets, often near the sea-coast, but are difficult of observation,
  owing to their shyness; they run swiftly with erect outspread tail, perch on low boughs, and have
  a harsh cry, varied by a plaintive note; the food consists of fruits, roots, and snails. The nest,
  containing one egg, is said to be placed at the foot of a tree. <i>Starnoenas cyanocephala</i>, of
  Cuba and the Florida Keys, is brown above and purplish-rufous below, with a blue crown surrounded
  by black, a black throat with a white basal line, a white stripe across each cheek, and red bill
  and feet varied with bluish. This bird, the "Perdiz" of the Cubans, frequents wooded hills and has
  somewhat gallinaceous habits; the food consists of seeds, berries, and snails, the hollow note
  having the effect of ventriloquism. Another long-legged, terrestrial genus from New Guinea is
  <i>Eutrygon</i>; <i>E. terrestris</i> being olivaceous lead-coloured, with rufous outer margins to
  the brown remiges, while <i>E. leucopareia</i> has a reddish hue on the wing-coverts.
  <i>Leucosarcia picata</i>, the white-fleshed Wonga-wonga of Eastern Australia, is blue-black with
  white forehead, pectoral band, and central abdomen. It inhabits the brushes, and feeds chiefly
  upon the ground on seeds, fruits, and insect-larvae; the flight is of short duration and the
  habits somewhat Pheasant-like; the nest is in a tree. <i>Phlogoenas</i> contains a score of
  members ranging from the Philippines and Timor to the Society Islands. <i>P. luzonica</i> of Luzon
  has purplish upper parts, a greyish-blue head, and yellowish-white lower parts, with a patch of
  stiff red decomposed feathers over the crop; the inner webs of the remiges are more or less
  rufous, a characteristic found also in <i>Chalcopelia</i>, <i>Columbigallina</i>,
  <i>Scardafella</i>, and <i>Leptoptila</i>, from very different parts of the world. <i>P.
  rufigula</i>, of New Guinea and the islands to the north-west, has the crop-patch yellowish-ochre;
  <i>P. tristigma</i> of North Celebes is perhaps most striking of all, with its yellow breast and
  forehead, green head, purple nape, and green and purple tints on the brown upper back; <i>P.
  stairi</i> of the Fiji and Tonga <span class="pagenum" id="page336"><span
  class="smaller">{336}</span></span>Islands has a greenish-grey head and brownish upper surface,
  with brilliant violet-purple on the wings and a vinous breast, while the female differs in being
  olive-brown, with the head and breast dull cinnamon. <i>P. kubaryi</i> of the Caroline group is
  almost entirely violet-purple above, the head being grey, the forehead, sides of the neck, throat,
  and breast white. <i>Geotrygon</i> with some dozen and a half species extends from South Mexico to
  Paraguay, several of them being peculiar to the West Indies. <i>G. montana</i>, the
  "Mountain-Partridge," ranges from Key West and Cuba to Paraguay. It has a purplish-rufous upper
  surface, while the lower parts are whitish-fawn colour, with a purplish breast. The female is
  olive with a tinge of gold above, and chiefly buff below, with browner breast. <i>G. chrysia</i>
  of Haiti, Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Florida Keys has reddish-brown upper parts, with reflexions
  of brilliant purple, green, and gold, and vinaceous-white lower parts. <i>G. violacea</i> of
  Central America and Brazil, <i>G. cristata</i>, the Mountain-Witch, of Jamaica, <i>G. linearis</i>
  of Colombia, and other species, bear a general resemblance to the above. These birds frequent
  thickly-wooded districts or mountainous tracts, where they feed upon the ground on seeds, fallen
  berries, snails, and slugs. They often have recourse to running, yet the flight is rapid and
  whirring; the note is a moaning coo, the nest a slight structure on bushes, trees, or even the
  ground. <i>Osculatia purpurea</i> and <i>O. sapphirina</i> are two beautiful Ecuadorian Pigeons,
  of which the former has a rich purple crown and occiput, a purplish-violet mantle with duller
  wings, a violet rump, a bronzy-green hind-neck, a white forehead, throat, and abdomen, a greyish
  breast, and white cheeks with a black transverse stripe below. The latter has the crown grey, the
  occiput golden-green. <i>Leptoptila</i> (<i>Engyptila</i> of some authors), distributed from Texas
  to Argentina, contains about seventeen somewhat similar forms, which have olive-brown upper parts,
  with red, green, and dove-coloured reflexions, and usually pinkish-white or greyish under parts.
  The wing-quills almost invariably shew some cinnamon on their inner webs, while in <i>L.
  rufinucha</i>, the region of the nape is rufous. The White-bellied Pigeon of Jamaica (<i>L.
  jamaicensis</i>) is an unsuspicious bird which habitually lives on the ground in woods, eats seeds
  and fruits, runs, walks, or flies for short distances, and sometimes uses straw instead of sticks
  for its nest. The genus <i>Haplopelia</i> is restricted to the Ethiopian <span class="pagenum"
  id="page337"><span class="smaller">{337}</span></span>Region, <i>H. larvata</i> of South Africa,
  <i>H. bronzina</i> of Abyssinia and Shoa, <i>H. principalis</i> of Prince's Island, <i>H.
  simplex</i> of St. Thomas, <i>H. johnstoni</i> of Nyassa-Land, and <i>H. inornata</i> of the
  Cameroons, being all much alike. The first-mentioned&ndash;common in woods near Cape Town&ndash;is
  plain brown, with green and purple gloss on the crown and nape, a white forehead and throat, and
  vinaceous breast with coppery reflexions. It is the Cinnamon or Lemon Dove of the colonists, and
  feeds chiefly on berries, obtained upon the ground.</p>

  <p>Group (<i>c</i>).&ndash;The third section of the Peristerinae is confined to the Old World, and
  shews metallic blue or green wing-spots or patches. <i>Ocyphaps lophotes</i>, the swift Crested
  Bronze-wing of the interior of Australia, is found in flocks, especially near water, and has a
  remarkable habit, when alighting, of erecting its long, black crest and elevating its tail until
  they almost meet. It is a grey bird, possessing bronzy-green wing-coverts tipped with white, a
  metallic purple gloss on the secondaries, and peacock-blue outer rectrices. <i>Lophophaps
  plumifera</i> of North-West Australia, which has a western race, <i>L. ferruginea</i>, and a
  southern, <i>L. leucogaster</i>, is a terrestrial species, frequenting creeks in the desert, and
  running on the ground like a Quail. The nest is a mere hole in the ground lined with a little
  grass; the eggs are said to be creamy-white. The Plumed Bronze-wing, as it is called, has the
  general plumage and full crest pale cinnamon, the throat white, with a black median stripe, a
  black gorget, a crescentic band of grey on the chest with a black line below, and a few purple
  spots on the secondaries. <i>Geophaps scripta</i>, the Partridge Bronze-wing or Squatter of
  North-West and East Australia, has a peculiar habit of squatting on the ground or on the branches
  of any tree in which it takes refuge. It is light brown above and grey below, with curious black
  and white markings on the sides of the head and throat; the wing-coverts have pale tips, and the
  innermost of the greater series greenish-purple outer webs. <i>G. smithi</i> of North-West
  Australia is browner. From the same parts comes <i>Petrophassa albipennis</i>, which frequents
  rocks, though its nest has not yet been recorded; it is a reddish-brown bird with greyer head,
  grey centres to the feathers, and concealed purplish spots on the wing-coverts; the throat is
  black and white, the primaries brown with white bases. <i>Histrioniphaps histrionica</i>, of the
  interior and North-West of Australia, has brown upper <span class="pagenum" id="page338"><span
  class="smaller">{338}</span></span>and grey under parts; the head is finely varied with jet-black
  and pure white, the secondaries shew patches of metallic-purple, and the primaries have white tips
  and partly rufous inner webs. The female is much duller. It is essentially a Ground-Pigeon, and
  breeds on the bare soil of the plains; but the flight is much stronger than might be expected, as
  is also the case with <i>Geophaps</i>. <i>Phaps chalcoptera</i> and <i>P. elegans</i>, of
  Australia and Tasmania, in their mode of life resemble the preceding, though the latter species is
  the more terrestrial, while both usually build in low trees or bushes. <i>P. chalcoptera</i>, the
  Common Bronze-wing, is extremely handsome, the greyish-brown upper surface being relieved by a
  purple band on the crown and most brilliant bronze and green spots upon the wing; the breast is
  pinkish, the throat white, and the forehead white with a wash of yellow. The inner webs of the
  remiges are partly rufous. <i>P. elegans</i>, the Brush Bronze-wing, is a shorter-winged bird,
  with chestnut throat and grey breast. <i>Henicophaps albifrons</i> of New Guinea and the adjacent
  western islands has the forehead whitish, the neck and under parts rich reddish-purple, the back
  blue-black, the wings glossed with golden-green and bronze, and their coverts margined with
  chestnut. The beak is longer and stouter than in the allied forms, and the bird is partly
  arboreal. <i>Calopelia puella</i> of West Africa is a fine cinnamon-coloured bird, with blue head
  and iridescent green spots on the wings. Of <i>Chalcophaps</i>, ranging from India, Burma, and
  South China, through the islands to Australia and the New Hebrides, Count Salvadori makes two
  divisions, though the species are little more than local races. Of the first of these, with
  golden-green mid-back and scapulars, <i>C. indica</i>, the Emerald Dove or Beetle-wing, may be
  taken as typical; the head is blue with white forehead and sides, the upper back is purplish, the
  wing-coverts golden-green, the lower back bronzy with two grey bars, the rump nearly black, and
  the under parts purplish-pink. The female is brown and somewhat redder below, with grey forehead.
  This species covers nearly the whole range of the genus, but only stretches eastward to Geelvink
  Bay in New Guinea. <i>C. chrysochlora</i> reaches from Timor to the New Hebrides; <i>C.
  sanghirensis</i> occurs in Great Sanghir Island; <i>C. natalis</i> in Christmas Island, Indian
  Ocean. <i>C. stephani</i>, of Celebes and Papuasia, and <i>C. mortoni</i>, of the Solomon Islands,
  constitute the second division, where the mid-back and <span class="pagenum" id="page339"><span
  class="smaller">{339}</span></span>scapulars are reddish-cinnamon. These Pigeons frequent bushy
  districts, feed on the ground on seeds and fruits, run fast, and fly swiftly for short distances.
  They have a mournful note, breed on low trees, and make a fairly compact nest of roots, grass, or
  twigs. <i>Chalcopelia afra</i> inhabits Africa south of Abyssinia and Senegambia. It has
  olive-brown upper parts, with two black stripes across the lower back, and a few large spots of
  brilliant purple and green on the wing; the under parts are pinkish, and the inner webs of the
  primaries and their coverts bright rufous. <i>C. chalcospilus</i>, with the spots golden-green, is
  probably a variety. They inhabit bushy country in pairs, the flight, food, note, and nest being
  similar to those of <i>Chalcophaps</i>. <i>Tympanistria bicolor</i> is a similar but greyer bird,
  with the purple spots almost black and the lower parts white; it inhabits Southern Africa,
  Madagascar, the Comoros, and Fernando Po. The very long-tailed <i>Oena capensis</i> is pale brown
  above and white below, with black face and throat, grey crown, two black bands across the lower
  back, and steel-blue patches on the wings. The inner webs of the primaries and their coverts are
  cinnamon. The female has a white face and throat. It is a bird of rough bushy country, which is
  seldom found in flocks, utters a deep plaintive note, and breeds in low trees. This species walks
  with the utmost rapidity, and feeds upon the ground on seeds of grasses and grain. It is found in
  tropical and Southern Africa, in Madagascar, and at Aden and Jeddah.</p>

  <p>Group (<i>d</i>).&ndash;The most typical Peristerinae constitute a fourth section, usually with
  metallic wing-spots, restricted to America. <i>Metriopelia melanoptera</i> and <i>M. aymara</i>
  range from Ecuador and Peru respectively to Chili and the borders of Argentina. The former is
  greyish-brown above and vinaceous below, with black wings and tail, the latter has golden spots on
  the wing-coverts. They are found in small flocks in the valleys of the Andes, and in winter on the
  coast, being called by the natives "Tortola cordillerana," or "Cordillera Dove." <i>Peristera
  cinerea</i> is bluish-grey in the male, with lighter under parts, black remiges and outer
  rectrices, some velvety black spots being very conspicuous on the wings and scapulars. The female
  is brown, with cinnamon wing-spots. This species ranges from South Mexico to Paraguay; while <i>P.
  geoffroyi</i>, with white-tipped lateral tail-feathers and a grey breast, inhabits South-East
  Brazil; <i>P. mondetoura</i>, with <span class="pagenum" id="page340"><span
  class="smaller">{340}</span></span>chestnut breast, occurs from South Mexico to Peru. They
  frequent wooded and hilly districts, forming small flocks and uttering a cry resembling
  "huup-huup." <i>Oxypelia cyanopis</i>, of the interior of Brazil, and <i>Uropelia campestris</i>,
  of that country and Bolivia, link the above genus to <i>Columbigallina</i>, which contains six
  species. <i>C. passerina</i> extends from the southern United States and the West Indies to Peru
  and Paraguay; <i>C. minuta</i> occupies a similar range, except for the United States; and <i>C.
  cruziana</i> reaches from Ecuador to North Chili&ndash;all with naked feet; <i>C. buckleyi</i>
  inhabits Ecuador and Peru; <i>C. talpacoti</i>, most of South America north of Paraguay; <i>C.
  rufipennis</i> ranges from Mexico to the north of South America, these three having the metatarsi
  feathered laterally. <i>C. passerina</i> is olive-grey, with violet spots on the wing and purplish
  coverts; the feathers of the forehead and under parts being vinous, with dull brown centres to the
  latter, and those of the hinder portion of the head bluish, with dusky margins, which cause a
  scaly appearance. The female lacks the purple and red tints. <i>C. minuta</i>, the most diminutive
  Pigeon known,&ndash;though <i>Oena</i> would be smaller but for its tail,&ndash;is uniform below.
  The other species differ but little, though only <i>C. rufipennis</i> has, like the above, the
  under surface of the wing cinnamon. Flocks of the Ground-Dove or Tortolita, as <i>C. passerina</i>
  is called, are found amongst open woods and pastures, running about with elevated tails, and
  feeding chiefly upon the ground on seeds, berries, peas, and grain; if disturbed, they betake
  themselves with low and noisy flight to a tree; but they are usually very tame, and may often be
  heard uttering their mournful notes on the roofs of outbuildings. The nest, placed in low bushes
  or on the ground, is carefully constructed and lined with grass, two or three broods being reared
  in the season. The hen is said to feign disablement at its nest like a Plover, while the birds
  apparently dust themselves in gallinaceous fashion. <i>Columbula picui</i>, distinguished by a
  blue band on the wing-coverts, occurs in South America from Bolivia and Chili eastward.</p>

  <p>Group (<i>e</i>).&ndash;The fifth section of the Peristerinae exhibit no metallic spots or
  lustre, while the wings are rounded and the tail is rather long. <i>Gymnopelia erythrothorax</i>,
  of the mountains of Peru, Bolivia, and North Chili, is brown, with vinaceous head and breast, and
  remarkably large naked orbits of orange margined with black. <i>Scardafella</i> has crescentic
  black edges to the feathers, the upper parts being brown and the lower pinky white, while the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page341"><span class="smaller">{341}</span></span>primaries have
  cinnamon inner webs. <i>S. squamosa</i>, of Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia, has a white
  wing-patch, absent in <i>S. inca</i>, extending from Texas to Nicaragua. These "Scaly Doves," as
  they are called, seem to be essentially terrestrial. <i>Geopelia humeralis</i>, of Australia and
  Southern New Guinea, is brown above, with black scale-like markings, a rufous nape, a bluish
  forehead and chest, a pinkish breast, and a white mid-belly. The remiges are rufous on the inner
  web. <i>G. cuneata</i>, of Australia only, has small white wing-spots, and no black marginal
  markings on the feathers. <i>G. tranquilla</i>, of the same country, <i>G. striata</i>, ranging
  from South Tenasserim to the Philippines and the Moluccas&ndash;introduced into Madagascar, the
  Mascarene Islands, and St. Helena&ndash;and <i>G. maugei</i>, found from the Timor group to the K&eacute;
  Islands, are distinctly banded with black and white, the first round the neck only, the other two
  on the breast also. These long-tailed species, resembling miniature Turtle-Doves, frequent grassy
  plains, thickets, or swampy river-sides in small flocks, and flit tamely from tree to tree,
  alighting with upturned tail; the coo is rarely loud; the food consists of seeds and berries,
  usually obtained upon the ground; the nest, placed rather low, is of twigs or grass.</p>

  <p>Group (<i>f</i>).&ndash;<i>Turtur</i> contains twenty-eight Old World forms, reaching eastward
  to Japan, the Ladrones, and the Moluccas. In habits resembling the members of the genus
  <i>Columba</i>, they are browner in coloration, and about three quarters of the size; while some
  exhibit lateral patches of dark feathers tipped with blue, grey, or white on the neck, the plumage
  whereof in other species is bifurcated and spotted with rufous or white. Many have a black nuchal
  collar, and a few somewhat fawn-coloured upper parts; the lower surface is more or less vinaceous,
  and the rectrices, except the two median, are tipped with white or grey. The following may
  exemplify the range of this sixth section of the Peristerinae:&ndash;<i>Turtur communis</i>, the
  Turtle-Dove of Europe, winters in Northern Africa and Western Asia; <i>T. douraca</i> or
  <i>risorius</i> (our common cage-bird), extends from Turkey to India and Japan; <i>T.
  orientalis</i>, accidental in Europe, only from India to Japan; <i>T. tigrinus</i> from the Malay
  countries to the Moluccas; <i>T. dussumieri</i> from Borneo to the Ladrones; <i>T.
  semitorquatus</i>, <i>T. isabellinus</i>, and so forth, inhabit Africa; <i>T. picturatus</i>
  Madagascar, <i>T. aldabranus</i>, <i>T. comorensis</i>, <i>T. coppingeri</i>, <i>T. abbotti</i>,
  and <i>T. rostratus</i> the neighbouring <span class="pagenum" id="page342"><span
  class="smaller">{342}</span></span>Islands. The African <i>T. senegalensis</i> is found in the
  Canaries, and several introduced species occur in Madagascar or Mauritius.</p>

  <p>Group (<i>g</i>).&ndash;The seventh section of the Peristerinae is characterized by metallic
  spots near the ear-coverts and an iridescent gloss on the sides of the neck. <i>Melopelia
  leucoptera</i>, found from Texas to Costa Rica and the West Indies, and the very similar <i>M.
  meloda</i> of Peru and Chili, have a white wing-patch. One of the notes resembles a cock's crow.
  <i>Nesopelia</i>, of the Gal&aacute;pagos, links these closely to <i>Zenaida</i>, with six members, found
  from the Florida Keys, Yucatan, and the Antilles, through South America to Patagonia. <i>Z.
  amabilis</i>, the Pea- or Mountain-Dove of the islands from the Florida Keys to Antigua, is
  reddish-olive, with vinous head and breast, two peacock-blue ear-spots, black blotches on the
  scapulars and wing-coverts, black remiges, and a white band across the secondaries. Chiefly
  terrestrial, it roosts and nests either on trees or on the ground, the flight being swift, and the
  note very soft. <i>Zenaidura carolinensis</i>, the Mourning-Dove of North America, including
  Southern Canada, is not unlike the above, but has the crown, sides of the body, and edges of the
  wings blue, and in the male the breast purplish. Small flocks often frequent the neighbourhood of
  houses, while the flight is strong, the note guttural and melancholy, the food of grain, berries,
  acorns, shoots of plants, and apparently worms. The nest is placed indifferently on the earth or
  aloft.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Columbinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Ectopistes migratorius</i>, the well-known
  Passenger-Pigeon, breeds in eastern North America, chiefly in Canada and the adjoining United
  States, and wanders to the Pacific and Cuba. Its immense colonies are seemingly a thing of the
  past, though as lately as 1888 a northward flight crossed Michigan, where in 1878, at Petosky, the
  "roost," or area occupied, is said to have been twenty-eight miles long by three or four broad.
  The trees were often laden with nests, and during a stay of five weeks several millions of birds
  are stated to have been captured, chiefly by means of nets and decoys; though earlier authors,
  such as Wilson, mention many different methods of slaughter. The parents were very noisy, and
  covered vast distances in search of food; but, save for the sharp call-note, and the single egg,
  the other habits were as in most arboreal Pigeons.</p>

  <p><i>Coryphoenas crassirostris</i>, of the Solomon Islands, a slate-coloured species with
  brownish head and crest, resembles in its <span class="pagenum" id="page343"><span
  class="smaller">{343}</span></span>very stout bill and long graduated rectrices <i>Reinwardtoenas
  reinwardti</i>, ranging from Celebes to Papuasia, and <i>R. browni</i>, of the Duke of York Island
  and New Britain. In the two last-named the head is grey, the under parts are white, and the naked
  orbits red, the former having the back chestnut, the latter black. Closely allied are the two
  dozen Pheasant-like members of <i>Macropygia</i>, with elongated wedge-shaped tails, from the
  Indian and Australian Regions, which have rich chestnut, purplish-brown, or cinnamon plumage, with
  darker shading and iridescent sheen, chiefly confined to the upper surface. The head is usually
  lighter, the under parts are often buff or vinaceous, and the irides parti-coloured; the naked
  orbits vary in tint. Inhabiting bushy country or hills up to about eight thousand feet, they fly
  but short distances, feeding upon the ground on seeds and berries, and uttering a loud monotonous
  note. <i>M. tusalia</i>, the Cuckoo-Dove, occurs from North India to West China; <i>M.
  leptogrammica</i> inhabits the Malay Countries; several other species carry the range to the
  Moluccas; <i>M. tenuirostris</i> occupies the Philippine and Sulu Islands; <i>M. phasianella</i>
  the eastern half of Australia; <i>M. doreya</i> and so forth New Guinea and its islands; <i>M.
  rufa</i> the New Hebrides; <i>M. rufo-castanea</i> the Solomons. The two last-named have
  bifurcated breast-feathers.</p>

  <p><i>Turacoena menadensis</i>, of Celebes, the Togian and Sula Islands, is slate-black with
  golden-green occiput, neck, and breast, white face and throat, and naked red orbits; <i>T.
  modesta</i>, of Timor, has the orbits yellow, and lacks the white. <i>Turturoena delegorgii</i>,
  of Natal, is slaty-black, with a chestnut mantle surmounted by a white band, lilac and green
  reflexions on the occiput, neck, and chest, vinous under parts, and bare pink orbits. The female
  is brownish-grey, having a cinnamon head and nape glossed with green, but no white collar. <i>T.
  sharpii</i>, of East Equatorial Africa, differs in its green crown and nuchal region; <i>T.
  iriditorques</i>, found from the Gaboon to Liberia, lacks the white band, and has the lateral
  rectrices tipped with buff; <i>Nesoenas mayeri</i>, of Mauritius, is reddish-brown, with pink
  head, neck, and lower surface.</p>

  <p>The cosmopolitan genus <i>Columba</i> contains nearly sixty members, of which comparatively few
  inhabit the Palaearctic and Nearctic Regions; the general coloration is blue, relieved by black
  and rufous, or a metallic red and green sheen. Want of space forbids a description of every form,
  and the following are in no definite order: but <i>C. palumbus</i>, <i>C. laurivora</i>, <i>C.
  bollii</i>, <i>C. trocaz</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page344"><span
  class="smaller">{344}</span></span><i>C. leucocephala</i>, and so forth, are Wood-Pigeons; <i>C.
  livia</i>, <i>C. schimperi</i>, <i>C. affinis</i>, <i>C. intermedia</i>, and <i>C. leuconota</i>
  are true Rock-Pigeons; <i>C. oenas</i> and its nearest allies being somewhat intermediate. <i>C.
  rufina</i>, extending from Guatemala to Peru and Brazil, and <i>C. speciosa</i>, ranging further
  north to Mexico, are especially ruddy; <i>C. ianthina</i>, of Japan and the Liu-Kiu Islands, is
  unusually metallic; <i>C. grisea</i>, of Borneo and Sumatra, is mainly light grey; <i>C.
  polleni</i>, of the Comoro Islands, olive-brown; <i>C. arquatrix</i>, of Eastern and South-Western
  Africa, is flecked with white above and below; <i>C. speciosa</i>, only on the hind neck; <i>C.
  guinea</i>, of Western and North-Eastern Africa, has bifurcated neck-feathers and triangular white
  wing-spots; <i>C. leucocephala</i>, of the Florida Keys, Bahamas, Antilles, and Honduras, and
  <i>C. leucomela</i>, of East Australia, have the crown, and the latter the neck and under parts
  white; <i>C. leuconota</i>, the "Snow-Pigeon" of Kashmir, Yarkand, and Tibet, has the neck, lower
  back, and breast white; <i>C. palumbus</i>, our Ring-Dove, Wood-Pigeon, Cushat, or Queest, the
  habits of which are universally known, extends through the Palaearctic Region from Madeira and the
  Azores to Persia; it differs from the smaller and darker Stock-Dove (<i>C. oenas</i>), of the same
  Region eastward to Turkestan, by the white patches on the sides of its neck and the white
  wing-bar. <i>C. livia</i>, the Rock-Dove, from which our domestic races have sprung, is easily
  distinguishable from other British species by the white rump and the two black alar bands. The
  breeding habits of our native birds, and the damage done by flocks of Wood-Pigeons, partly
  composed of immigrants, have already been mentioned (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page328">328</a></span>). <i>Columba laurivora</i> and <i>C. bollii</i>, which lays but one
  egg, are peculiar to the Canary Islands; <i>C. trocaz</i> to Madeira, <i>C. torringtoniae</i> to
  Ceylon, <i>C. palumbo&iuml;des</i> to the Andamans and Nicobars, <i>C. metallica</i> to Timor, <i>C.
  gymnophthalma</i>, apparently to Cura&ccedil;ao, Aruba, and Bonaire, and several forms to Samoa, the
  Liu-Kiu, Bonin, Fiji, and other groups. <i>C. araucana</i> reaches the Straits of Magellan.</p>

  <p><i>Gymnophaps albertisi</i>, of New Guinea, is grey, with whitish breast, purplish-chestnut
  under parts elsewhere, and naked red orbits.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 4. <i>Treroninae.</i>&ndash;This includes the Fruit-Pigeons in the widest sense,
  natives of the Old World, of which the bigger are contained in the first eight genera.
  <i>Hemiphaga novae zealandiae</i>, of New Zealand, is green, with brilliant coppery reflexions,
  brownish-purple back, and white abdomen; <i>H. spadicea</i>, of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page345"><span class="smaller">{345}</span></span>Norfolk Island, and <i>H. chathamensis</i>,
  of the Chatham group, have greyer wing-coverts and green nape. <i>Lopholaemus antarcticus</i>, of
  Eastern Australia, is grey, with a fine rufous crest, black remiges, black rectrices banded with
  grey, and bare reddish orbits; the neck-feathers being hackled as in <i>Caloenas</i>. In
  <i>Myristicivora</i> the general plumage is white, but <i>M. bicolor</i>, of the Malay
  Archipelago, has black wing-quills and tip to the tail; the similar <i>M. spilorrhoa</i> of
  Australia and Papuasia, the yellower <i>M. subflavescens</i> of New Ireland, and the
  blacker-tailed <i>M. melanura</i> of the Moluccas, have black spots near the vent; <i>M.
  luctuosa</i>, of Celebes and the Sula Islands, has the remiges nearly grey.</p>

  <p><i>Phaenorrhina goliath</i>, of New Caledonia and the Isle of Pines, is slaty-black, with
  maroon patches on the wing-coverts and abdomen, black quills, and a broad chestnut tail-bar.</p>

  <p>The forty to fifty species of <i>Carpophaga</i> range from India to Hainan and Fiji. <i>C.
  concinna</i>, found in the Moluccas, Tenimber, K&eacute;, and Aru Islands, is metallic bronzy-green with
  grey head and lower surface; <i>C. aenea</i>, extending from India and Ceylon to Hainan and
  Flores, has more vinaceous lower parts and greener tail; <i>C. latrans</i>, of Fiji, is nearly
  brown above; <i>C. zoeae</i>, of Papuasia, has a chestnut mantle and black pectoral band. <i>C.
  griseipectus</i>, of the Philippines, has a grey back with blackish-green spots, and a chestnut
  lower breast; <i>C. basilica</i>, of the Halmahera group, has a pinkish-white head and upper
  breast, a rufous lower breast, and a broad grey tip to the tail; <i>C. cuprea</i>, of Southern
  India, is brown, with white throat, greyish-pink head, neck, mantle, and under parts; <i>C.
  poecilorrhoa</i>, of North Celebes, is glossy greenish-black above with grey head, mantle, and
  chest, and brown breast with ochre markings; <i>C. pinon</i>, of New Guinea and the Western Papuan
  Islands, is slaty-grey with a white forehead, a ring of white feathers round the naked red orbits,
  and a purplish-chestnut lower breast. Large flocks commonly gather after breeding. The seven
  species of <i>Globicera</i>, remarkable for a fleshy knob at the base of the bill, may be
  represented by <i>C. pacifica</i>, ranging from New Guinea to Samoa, and <i>C. rubricera</i>, of
  New Ireland, New Britain, New Hanover, and the Duke of York Island. The former has a grey head,
  bronzy-green upper parts, bluer remiges and rectrices and pinkish lower surface, the knob being
  black. The latter has a vinous head, grey mantle, chestnut abdomen, and red knob. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page346"><span class="smaller">{346}</span></span><i>Serresius galeatus</i>,
  of the Marquesas Islands, noted for the feathered skin or "saddle" covering half the culmen, is
  deep glossy green, with dark grey head and under parts. All these Fruit-Pigeons feed and build on
  lofty trees, and seldom, if ever, descend to the ground&ndash;possessing short legs and
  broad-soled grasping feet; they have a powerful rapid flight and utter varied notes, occasionally
  deep and booming like a wild beast's roar; they eat vast quantities of fruit, and some are very
  fond of mice; while they normally lay two eggs, but exceptionally one.</p>

  <p>The five splendid species of <i>Megaloprepia</i> occupy the Northern Moluccas, Papuasia, and
  Eastern Australia. <i>M. magnifica</i> of the latter country has a greenish-grey head and neck,
  golden-green upper parts with an oblique yellow band on the wing-coverts, rich purple breast and
  abdomen, and yellow vent. <i>M. formosa</i> of the Halmahera group lacks the yellow on the wings
  and has, in the male only, a crimson patch on the greenish breast. The other three species are
  barely separable. The habits resemble those of <i>Carpophaga</i>, the note being peculiarly
  hoarse.</p>

  <p><i>Alectoroenas</i> comprises four remarkable forms from Madagascar and the neighbouring
  islands, of which <i>A. nitidissima</i> of Mauritius has become extinct within historic times,
  three specimens being still extant at Port Louis, Paris, and Edinburgh respectively. This species,
  called "Pigeon hollondais" from its colours, which are those of the Dutch flag, is indigo-blue,
  with white head and neck, vermilion tail-coverts and tail edged with black, and red carunculated
  orbits, lores, and forehead. <i>A. madagascariensis</i>, of Madagascar and Nossib&eacute; Island, has
  most of the neck slaty-grey, but the head blue, and the tail crimson with a wash of blue and green
  at the base, while the naked skin only surrounds the eyes. <i>A. pulcherrima</i> of the
  Seychelles, to which the name of "Pigeon hollondais" has been transferred, has the neck and breast
  grey, the upper parts, including the tail, black with blue reflexions, the crown crimson, the
  orbits, lores, and forehead wattled. <i>A. sganzini</i> of the Comoro Islands differs in having a
  grey head and only the orbits bare. Throughout the genus the long, loosely webbed and bifurcated
  neck-feathers resemble hackles in appearance. The members are, according to circumstances, tame
  and stupid, or shy and wary; they are arboreal and fly powerfully, while they feed on dates, figs,
  berries and grain, the flocks being very destructive to rice-crops. <i>Drepanoptila
  holosericea</i>, of New Caledonia and <span class="pagenum" id="page347"><span
  class="smaller">{347}</span></span>the Isle of Pines, with its feathered white metatarsi and
  fork-tipped primaries, is green, with grey wing- and tail-bars, white throat and yellow abdomen,
  the last being divided from the breast by a yellowish-white and a black band.</p>

  <p>Of the smaller Fruit-Pigeons, which differ but little in habits from the larger, the lovely
  genus <i>Chrysoenas</i> is confined to Fiji. <i>C. luteovirens</i> has an olive-yellow head, and a
  bright yellow abdomen and collar; the remaining plumage being yellow, more or less tinged with
  green, especially on the wings and tail. The feathers of the neck and back are narrowly lanceolate
  and the tail-coverts long. The female is green, with a yellow wash below, and has nearly brown
  remiges. <i>C. victor</i> is bright orange, with olive-yellow head and throat and browner
  wing-quills; the coverts almost conceal the tail, but the long decomposed body-feathers are not
  especially narrow. The female is green, with yellowish head and orange-margined remiges. <i>C.
  viridis</i> is dark green, with a golden hue on the back and breast, the head being almost yellow,
  as are the edges of the quills. The female is green, with grey vent-region. The seventy or more
  brilliantly coloured members of the genus <i>Ptilopus</i> range from the Malay Peninsula to the
  Marquesas; New Guinea and Polynesia accounting for a large majority. The following are some of the
  most striking. <i>P. jambu</i> of the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, Bangka, and Billiton has
  the front half of the head crimson, the upper parts bright green, the primaries black, margined
  with bluish-green, the tip of the tail yellowish, and the under parts white, with a purplish-brown
  streak down the throat, a rosy smear on the breast, and a red-brown anal region. The female has
  dull purple on the head and a greyish-green breast. The following three species have bifurcated
  breast-feathers. <i>P. dupetit-thouarsi</i> of the Marquesas has the crown whitish, encircled by a
  yellowish line, the upper surface green with yellow margins to the wing-quills and tip to the
  tail, the scapulars and inner secondaries spotted with blue, the under parts yellowish-green, with
  a cherry-coloured patch surrounded by orange on the breast, the throat and vent pale yellow. <i>P.
  swainsoni</i> of Eastern Australia, straying to South-East New Guinea, has a rose-lilac forehead
  and crown with a yellow margin behind, bright green upper parts with yellow edges to the
  wing-quills and peacock-blue tips to the inner secondaries and scapulars, a yellow tip to the
  tail, a <span class="pagenum" id="page348"><span class="smaller">{348}</span></span>pale yellow
  throat, a dull green breast with silvery grey tips to the feathers, and a lilac band dividing this
  from the orange abdomen. The female is rather brighter green. <i>P. superbus</i> of the Moluccas,
  Papuasia and North Australia, has a purple cap, rufous-orange nape and sides of the neck, rich
  green upper surface, with deep blue spots on the scapulars and wings and a patch of the same
  colour at the bend of the latter, black primaries with yellow margins, a whitish throat, and a
  purple and grey breast, separated from the white abdomen and green and white vent by a broad
  violet-black band. The female has green upper parts, with blue spots on the wing-region and one on
  the occiput, and a grey and green breast. <i>P. insolitus</i> of New Ireland, New Britain, and the
  Duke of York Island, with its curious orange frontal knob, is green, with grey lesser wing-coverts
  and inner secondaries, a grey-tipped tail, an orange abdomen, and a yellowish vent-region. <i>P.
  aurantiifrons</i> of Papuasia has a yellowish-green head with orange forehead; a white throat;
  grey neck, upper breast, tip of the tail, and spots on the scapulars and wing-coverts; the
  remaining plumage being chiefly green. <i>P. nanus</i> of the same districts, the smallest of the
  Sub-family, is bronzy-green with a greyish band on each side of the breast, a yellow vent, and a
  purple abdominal patch, lacking in the female. <i>Phabotreron</i> is a group of similar species
  confined to the Philippines. <i>P. amethystina</i> is bronzy-brown with an amethystine nape and
  lower surface, the cheeks are crossed by a black line over a white one, the throat is reddish, the
  tip of the tail grey. The lines on the cheeks and a rounded tail are characteristic of the
  genus.</p>

  <p>The remaining members of the Treroninae are of a greenish or yellowish coloration, generally
  varied with patches or bands of dull purple, red, orange, or lilac&ndash;nearly or quite absent in
  the females, except in <i>Vinago</i>, where the sexes are similar. This genus is Ethiopian, while
  the others reach from India eastward to Japan, Formosa, and the Moluccas. <i>Osmotreron</i>
  contains a dozen and a half species, of which the following may serve as examples. <i>O.
  vernans</i>, ranging from the Malay countries to Cochin-China, the Philippines, and Celebes, has a
  greyish head and throat, vinaceous-purple neck, dull green upper parts, yellowish-green lower
  surface with an orange pectoral patch, rufescent upper and chestnut under tail-coverts; the
  wing-quills are black with yellow margins to the coverts, and the grey tail exhibits a black <span
  class="pagenum" id="page349"><span class="smaller">{349}</span></span>subterminal bar on the
  lateral feathers. The small <i>O. olax</i> of the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo, has the
  back maroon, the head and neck grey. <i>O. pompadora</i> of Ceylon has the forehead and throat
  yellow, the mantle maroon, and the median rectrices green. <i>O. aromatica</i> of Bouru differs in
  having no yellow forehead, and the bend of the wing blackish.</p>

  <p><i>Treron nipalensis</i> and the very closely allied <i>T. nasica</i> are found from Bengal and
  Nepal to the Indo-Malay Islands, the Philippines, and Cochin-China; they have grey heads, chestnut
  mantles, black wings with yellow edges to the coverts and secondaries, cinnamon under
  tail-coverts, grey lateral rectrices banded with black, and green plumage elsewhere. <i>Butreron
  capellii</i>, of the Malay Peninsula and neighbouring islands, has the head and upper parts
  greyish-green, the wings nearly as in the last species, the throat and abdomen yellowish-green,
  the breast orange, and the under tail-coverts chestnut.</p>

  <p><i>Crocopus</i>, with its three similar members, extends from India and Ceylon to Cochin-China.
  <i>C. chlorigaster</i> has a grey head and tail, a yellowish-green neck and under surface, a grey
  band across the mantle, a yellow alar bar, an olive-green back and rump, a purple patch at the
  bend of the wing, and rufous and white lower tail-coverts.</p>

  <p>Half a dozen species of <i>Vinago</i> range from Senegambia and Abyssinia to Madagascar and
  Cape Colony. <i>V. waalia</i>, found from West to North-East Africa, has a greenish-grey head and
  neck, olive upper parts, blackish-brown remiges with yellow outer margins, a rich vinous patch on
  the wing-coverts, a slaty-blue tail, a bright yellow breast, and a buff abdomen. <i>V. calva</i>,
  of the Ethiopian Region northward of Angola and the Zambesi, has a curious bare forehead and
  frontal swelling, a yellowish-green head, neck, and lower surface, and a grey collar at the base
  of the hind-neck. <i>V. crassirostris</i> is confined to St. Thomas and Rollas Islands, West
  Africa; <i>V. australis</i> to Madagascar. <i>Sphenocercus</i>, with some eight members, having
  wedge-shaped tails and a general resemblance in colour, reaches from North India, Sumatra, Borneo,
  and Java, to Japan and Formosa. <i>S. sphenurus</i>, of the Himalayas and the Burmese countries,
  has the head, neck, and under parts greenish-yellow with a rufous tinge, the back purplish- and
  bluish-green, the rump and wing-coverts olive with a maroon patch on the latter, and the remiges
  slaty-black with yellow <span class="pagenum" id="page350"><span
  class="smaller">{350}</span></span>margins.  <i>S. sieboldi</i> is peculiar to Japan, <i>S.
  sororius</i> and <i>S. formosae</i> to Formosa, <i>S. permagnus</i> to the Liu-Kiu Islands.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Comparatively few fossil forms of the Columbidae have been discovered, but
  <i>Columba</i> occurs in the Lower Miocene of France and in Malta, while <i>Lithophaps ulnaris</i>
  and <i>Progura gallinacea</i> are recorded from the Queensland Drifts, and <i>Alectoroenas?
  rodericana</i> is an extinct species from Rodriguez.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac"><b>Order XII. CUCULIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The Order Cuculiformes commences the last great division of Carinate Birds. It contains the
  Sub-Orders <span class="sc">Cuculi</span> and <span class="sc">Psittaci</span>; the former
  consisting of the Families <i>Cuculidae</i>, or Cuckoos, and <i>Musophagidae</i>, or
  Plantain-eaters; the latter of the <i>Psittacidae</i>, or Parrots, Parrakeets, Macaws, and
  Cockatoos, and the <i>Trichoglossidae</i>, or Lory group. Zygodactylous feet (<span class="wnw">p.
  <a href="#page10">10</a></span>) are characteristic of the Order, while further structural details
  are to be found below. Dr. Gadow confirms the close connexion of the two Sub-Orders.<a
  id="NtA_214" href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Cuculidae</b>.&ndash;Here we may accept, in default of full anatomical
  investigation, the Sub-families of Captain Shelley,<a id="NtA_215"
  href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> namely, (1) <i>Cuculinae</i>, (2) <i>Centropodinae</i>, (3)
  <i>Phaenicophainae</i>, (4) <i>Neomorphinae</i>, (5) <i>Diplopterinae</i>, and (6)
  <i>Crotophaginae</i>.</p>

  <p>The bill is generally long and curved, being strongly arched in <i>Hyetornis</i>, <i>Piaya</i>,
  <i>Taccocua</i>, and <i>Zanclostomus</i>; it is straight in <i>Saurothera</i> and
  <i>Rhinortha</i>, abnormally large in <i>Rhamphomantis</i> and <i>Scythrops</i>, and has the
  maxilla compressed into a thin elevated plate in <i>Crotophaga</i>. The scutellated metatarsi are
  commonly stout, and are especially long in the cursorial genera <i>Coua</i> and <i>Geococcyx</i>;
  in <i>Centropus</i> the hallux terminates in an elongated spur-like claw. The wings are long and
  straight in the Cuculinae, Diplopterinae, and Crotophaginae, short and curved elsewhere; the
  primaries numbering ten, and the secondaries usually nine or ten, but thirteen in
  <i>Scythrops</i>; in the Neomorphinae the quills are about equal in extent. The rounded <span
  class="pagenum" id="page352"><span class="smaller">{352}</span></span>or wedge-shaped tail is
  nearly always long, and has ten feathers, except in the Crotophaginae, which have eight; it is
  forked in two species of <i>Surniculus</i>. <i>Diplopterus</i> has the upper coverts half as long
  as the rectrices, <i>Dromococcyx</i> has them of the entire length. The impervious nostrils,
  usually pierced in a swollen membrane, are hidden by bristly plumes in <i>Dasylophus</i> and
  <i>Lepidogrammus</i>. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">Y</span>-shaped, the tongue is
  sagittate with retroverted spines on the posterior margin, the syrinx is tracheo-bronchial or
  occasionally bronchial. Distinct eyelashes are often visible, the after-shaft is rudimentary or
  absent, the nestlings are naked, and down is only found in adults on the unfeathered spaces.</p>

  <p>The plumage of the more typical Cuckoos is brownish or grey, usually with barred under parts,
  the long flank-feathers covering half the metatarsi; <i>Chrysococcyx</i>, however, contains
  several beautiful emerald-green forms; while <i>Chalcococcyx</i> is scarcely less brilliant; but
  <i>Surniculus</i> and <i>Cuculus clamosus</i> are black. <i>Crotophaga</i> is also black.
  <i>Coccystes</i>, and several species of <i>Coua</i>, have well-developed crests, while
  <i>Lepidogrammus</i> has a rounded tuft, <i>Guira</i> one of long narrow plumes, and <i>Geococcyx
  mexicanus</i> an erectile patch. Fork-tipped feathers on the head and neck are not uncommon. The
  colour of the bill, feet, and iris varies much; the cheeks and orbits are often naked, and may be
  bright red, blue, or greyish, as in the Phoenicophainae and Centropodinae. Strong glossy
  feather-shafts, often with filiform extremities, are found in <i>Coua</i>, <i>Taccocua</i>,
  <i>Phoenicopha&euml;s</i>, <i>Rhopodytes</i> and elsewhere, on the head, neck, mantle and chest;
  <i>Crotophaga</i> has stiff, scale-like borders, and <i>Lepidogrammus</i> metallic horny tips, to
  the feathers of the first two of these; <i>Dasylophus</i> has fine crimson hair-like tufts
  springing from above each eye. The beak may be black, green, yellowish, or even, as in
  <i>Rhamphococcyx</i>, chiefly red. The sexes are alike in most cases.</p>

  <p>The Ethiopian and Indian Regions are richest in Cuculidae. New Zealand possesses only two
  species; but Madagascar, besides other forms, claims the entire genus <i>Coua</i>. In all there
  are more than a hundred and sixty species of some forty-two genera.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Cuculinae</i>.&ndash;<i>Cuculus canorus</i>, the familiar Cuckoo of Britain and
  nearly all the Old World, is greyish-brown above and on the throat, the lower parts being white
  barred with dusky, and the wings and tail shewing a few white markings. A chestnut-brown or
  "hepatic" phase is sometimes met with. <span class="pagenum" id="page353"><span
  class="smaller">{353}</span></span>The young are brown mottled with white on the nape. Its flight
  and general coloration give the Cuckoo a distinctly Hawk-like appearance, and cause it to be
  systematically mobbed by small birds, while ignorant peasants persecute it mercilessly, and assert
  that it "changes to a Hawk" in winter. Certain other members of the Family have the same raptorial
  aspect, notably the Asiatic Hawk-Cuckoo (<i>Hierococcyx</i>); whereas several of the Centropodinae
  unconsciously mimic Pheasants in their colour, in their red orbits and their wedge-shaped tail.
  <i>Geococcyx</i> is still more like a Galline bird in some respects; and <i>Surniculus</i> is a
  decidedly good imitation of a Drongo (Dicruridae).</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In early April the Cuckoo's note heralds the approaching summer in Britain, and continues to be
  heard until June, after which it becomes hoarser and the first syllable is doubled; in July the
  adults begin to disappear, yet stray examples&ndash;chiefly, if not entirely, young&ndash;remain
  up to October, when they migrate as far as South Africa, Ceylon, and Celebes. None breed south of
  North Africa and the Himalayas. The eggs are invariably deposited in the nests of other birds,
  which rear the intruder and feed it until it leaves the country; but it is doubtful how many are
  <span class="pagenum" id="page354"><span class="smaller">{354}</span></span>produced in a
  season&ndash;possibly five or six&ndash;or whether the same hen ever places two or more in one
  nest. It is now certain that the egg is laid on the ground and conveyed to the chosen nursery in
  the bill, an occurrence said to have been actually witnessed by Adolf M&uuml;ller, a forester in
  Darmstadt.</p>

  <p>Closely connected with the above parasitic habit is the question of the colour of the egg. Red
  or blue specimens have undoubtedly been found in Germany and elsewhere, as well as the typical
  brown or greyish varieties; but they do not always assimilate to those of the foster-parent,
  albeit to the eggs of Pipits, Wagtails, and so forth, that of a Cuckoo is often exactly similar.
  The theories advanced to account for this are by no means conclusive, though hereditary habit may
  afford a clue; we may, however, be sure that the hen cannot determine the colour of her egg.</p>

  <p>With us the most usual foster-parents are the Meadow-Pipit, Pied Wagtail, Reed Warbler,
  Hedge-Sparrow and Robin, perhaps in the above order. They seldom, if ever, seem to resent the
  intrusion, or to notice their consequent losses. The careful observations of Jenner, Hancock, and
  Mrs. Blackburn shew that the young Cuckoo, when some thirty hours old, begins unaided to remove
  from the nest the rightful progeny or unhatched eggs by means of its broad back, which has a
  central depression for the first twelve days; but after this hollow is filled up the desire is
  said to cease. It pushes below a nestling with its wings, and raises it with much exertion to the
  edge of the nest, finally ejecting it by a supreme effort.</p>

  <p>The probable reason why the Cuckoo's egg often hatches first is the hen's habit of selecting
  nests with only one or two fresh eggs. Subsequently she neglects her offspring entirely. It is
  stated that the males, who alone utter the well-known notes, decidedly outnumber the females, and
  that no strict pairing takes place; while in the courting season a curious bubbling sound,
  attributed to the hen, may be heard as two or three individuals chase each other along the
  hedgerows. Wooded districts and bare hill-moors are equally frequented, trees being constantly
  used as perches. The quick, straight flight is varied by twists and swoops; the food consists of
  insects and their larvae, the stomach often becoming lined with hairs of caterpillars. Our Cuckoo
  does not eat eggs, but various foreign species add to their diet seeds and other fruits,
  land-molluscs, worms, frogs, lizards, small snakes, birds, and mice. <i>Chalcococcyx lucidus</i>
  bruises its food before swallowing it.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page355"><span class="smaller">{355}</span></span></div>

  <p>The genus <i>Coccystes</i>, of South Europe, Africa, and Tropical Asia, includes the Great
  Spotted Cuckoo (<i>C. glandarius</i>), which has twice occurred in Britain, a crested
  greyish-brown bird, with a yellowish throat, white under parts and markings above. In Southern
  Spain and Northern Africa it deposits from two to four eggs in the nests of the Magpies, <i>Pica
  rustica</i>, <i>P. mauritanica</i>, and <i>Cyanopica cooki</i>, or of the Grey Crow, <i>Corvus
  cornix</i>; these eggs, like those of the foster parents, being pale green with brown and lilac
  markings. The note of the male is "kee-ou, kee-ou" or "kark-kark", of the female "burroo-burroo."
  <i>C. coromandus</i>, chiefly greenish- and bluish-black above with rufous wings and white nuchal
  collar, and buff below with grey abdomen, ranges from India and Ceylon to China and Celebes,
  laying roundish, plain green-blue eggs in nests of <i>Crateropus</i> and other birds, and having a
  true Cuckoo's note. <i>C. serratus</i> of South Africa, which is greenish-black with a white alar
  band, is somewhat terrestrial, and lays a white egg in nests of <i>Pycnonotus</i> and
  <i>Sigelus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Surniculus lugubris</i>, extending from India to China and the Malay Islands, is black, with
  green and purple reflexions and a few scattered white markings. The tail is sometimes forked.
  <i>Cacomantis passerinus</i>, of India, Java, and Sumatra, is grey, having an olive gloss above,
  blue-black rectrices with white bars, and white abdomen. It frequents jungles, utters a plaintive
  series of whistles, continuing for hours, and lays bluish eggs with purplish, markings in various
  birds' nests. <i>C. virescens</i> of Celebes and Bouru is said by Dr. Meyer to build its own nest.
  <i>Chrysococcyx smaragdineus</i>, of Tropical and Southern Africa, is a lovely emerald-green bird,
  with yellow breast and white-barred lateral rectrices. The female has a partially rufous head and
  mantle, coppery, bronze, and green upper parts, and white lower surface banded with green. The
  males whistle loudly to their mates for long periods, perched on tall trees, or hawk for insects
  in the air. <i>C. cupreus</i>, of the same countries, is in both sexes coppery-green varied with
  white above, and white with bronzy bars below; it is called "Di-dric" from its cry, and lays white
  eggs in Sun-birds' and Finches' nests. The similarly coloured <i>Chalcococcyx lucidus</i> of
  Australia, New Zealand, and the Chatham Islands has a reiterated plaintive note, with the effect
  of ventriloquism, and foists its greenish-white eggs with brown spots upon <i>Acanthiza</i> and
  <i>Gerygone</i>.</p>

  <p>Of <i>Eudynamis</i>, ranging from India and Ceylon to Australia <span class="pagenum"
  id="page356"><span class="smaller">{356}</span></span>and Polynesia, the black males are barely
  distinguishable, but the females vary, and are black, brown, rufous, and white. <i>E.
  honorata</i>, the noisy Indian Ko&euml;l, has a loud melodious or hoarse whistling note, supposed to
  portend rain; it feeds on fruit, and lays from one to four greenish eggs with brown and grey
  blotches in nests of Crows. <i>E. melanorhyncha</i> is the "foreteller at night" of Celebes.<a
  id="NtA_216" href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> The extraordinary <i>Scythrops novae
  hollandiae</i>, or Channel-bill, of Australia, Papuasia, and the Moluccas, has a grey head,
  brownish back, and whitish under parts with indistinct dusky bars, the tail exhibiting a
  subterminal blackish and a terminal white band. The large maxilla has two lateral grooves, the
  bare lores and orbits are scarlet. This big bird flies like a Hawk, and is possibly parasitic;
  while eggs, taken from the oviduct, are white with pinkish-brown spots. The weird cry or shriek is
  syllabled krok, and the flocks feed on fruits and insects.</p>

  <p><i>Coccyzus americanus</i>, the Yellow-billed Cuckoo of America, has occurred in Britain, and
  ranges from the Great Plains, Canada, and New Brunswick to Argentina; it is an arboreal species,
  pairing and building&ndash;apparently twice a year&ndash;a slight flat nest of twigs, grass, and
  moss, lined with leaves. It lays from three to five light greenish eggs, and the hen feigns
  lameness when danger threatens the young. <i>C. occidentalis</i> is a more western form. <i>C.
  erythrophthalmus</i>, the American Black-billed Cuckoo, has been killed in Ireland and Italy. The
  coloration in the eight members of this genus is brownish-grey, relieved by rufous, the under
  parts being buff or white.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Centropodinae.</i>&ndash;This group comprises only the thirty or more large
  Coucals (<i>Centropus</i>) of the Ethiopian Region, Egypt, Madagascar, India, and the countries
  thence to China, Papuasia, and Australia. <i>C. sinensis</i>, the Crow-Pheasant, extending from
  India and Ceylon to China, is black with purple and green reflexions, the mantle being chestnut;
  <i>C. unirufus</i> of the Philippines is entirely rufous. They are strong-billed, long-legged
  birds with terrestrial tendencies, noisy yet often shy, which fly heavily, run, climb, leap, or
  glide with up-turned tail about the trees in forests and jungles, and utter a mellow "hoo-too" or
  a chuckle. The food consists of insects and their larvae, molluscs, reptiles, small mammals, and
  nestling birds. They make a large globular nest of twigs and leaves, or even of rushes, grass, and
  rags, <span class="pagenum" id="page357"><span class="smaller">{357}</span></span>with a lateral
  hole; it is placed in a tree, a thorny bush, or a tuft of herbage. The three to six oval eggs are
  white or bluish with a readily-stained chalky coating; the young are soon able to skulk among the
  foliage. <i>C. toulou</i> is held sacred in Madagascar.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Phoenicophainae.</i>&ndash;<i>Taccocua sirkee</i>, the Indian Sirkeer, has
  somewhat similar habits, but makes a flat nest. It is olive-brown above, relieved by black and
  white, and rufous below. <i>Coua</i> is peculiar to Madagascar, <i>C. caerulea</i> having loose
  blue plumage, glossed with violet on the tail, and dark blue naked orbits; but the other species
  are more olive or grey, with black or rufous on the head, throat, or mantle. The large, shy
  members of this handsome genus frequent the edges of forests; but whereas five species fly heavily
  and climb well, jumping from branch to branch with elevated rectrices, occasionally assisted by
  their beaks, the remaining seven rarely leave the ground, where they run about with the tail
  trailing. The note is a harsh "tashu" or a sharp "turruh"; the food consists of seeds, insects,
  worms, small mammals, birds, and molluscs&ndash;the last broken on stones; the nest of twigs and
  fibres is placed in high trees, and contains two or three white eggs.<a id="NtA_217"
  href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Saurothera</i>, <i>Hyetornis</i>, and <i>Piaya</i> are the "Rain-birds" of the Bahamas and
  Antilles, the latter genus extending to Bolivia and Argentina. They are inactive, wary birds,
  which hide and creep about with outspread tails when in the trees, but are more at ease upon the
  ground; the cry is a loud harsh scream or cackle; the food consists of insects, berries, lizards,
  and mice; the flat nest contains two or three white eggs. <i>P. cayana</i> is reddish-brown above
  with a violet tinge, and grey below with pinkish throat; the tail shewing a subterminal black bar
  and a white tip, and the bare orbits being red. <i>Phoenicopha&euml;s pyrrhocephalus</i> of Ceylon is
  dark green, with bluish wings, blackish head and chest, tail varied with white, and white breast;
  the forehead and sides of the head being red and rugose. It is a fruit-eating forest species, said
  to be parasitic, though the allied <i>Rhopodytes</i> of the Indian Region lays two or three white
  eggs in a slight nest of sticks and leaves, while the pugnacious <i>Rhamphococcyx
  calorhynchus</i>, the "foreteller by day" of Celebes, builds a similar structure.<a id="NtA_218"
  href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 4. <i>Neomorphinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Geococcyx mexicanus</i>, the curious Chapparal-Cock
  or Road-runner of the South-Western United States and Mexico, frequents thinly-wooded country,
  hilly cactus-regions <span class="pagenum" id="page358"><span
  class="smaller">{358}</span></span>or barren plains. The plumage is brownish, with white margins
  to the feathers and a purple tinge on the rufous-mottled head, neck, and breast; the back is
  greener, the tail more lilac, the abdomen white, the bare orbits blue and red. With its long stout
  legs this species covers the ground very quickly, running with outstretched neck, elevated crest,
  slightly expanded wings, and jerking tail, or springing into trees and taking brief flights: it is
  even difficult to outpace it with dogs or on horseback. It eats insects, snapping some in the bill
  as it leaps into the air, and enjoys grasshoppers, mice, and lizards; in captivity it is thievish.
  The note is low, the beak being occasionally clattered. The nest of twigs and grass, placed in
  bushes, contains from three to nine white eggs, the male apparently assisting in incubation.
  <i>Carpococcyx radiatus</i> of Borneo, and <i>C. viridis</i> of Sumatra, are the only Old World
  species in this group.</p>

  class="pagenum" id="page359"><span class="smaller">{359}</span></span>bird with darker streaks and
  white under surface, may represent this Central and South American group, of which the only other
  members are two species of <i>Dromococcyx</i>.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 6. <i>Crotophaginae.</i>&ndash;Of these birds, peculiar to the New World,
  <i>Crotophaga ani</i>, the Ani, Black Parrot, or Savannah-blackbird, extending from the Southern
  United States and the Antilles to most of South America, is glossy purplish- or greenish-black,
  and has the smooth maxilla compressed into a thin vertical plate, which, like the bare orbits, is
  black. Its grotesque appearance and alleged malpractices have given it the name of Black Witch in
  the West Indies. <i>C. sulcirostris</i>, ranging from Texas to Peru, has the bill grooved; <i>C.
  major</i> of South America is larger and greener. Far from shifting the burden of incubation upon
  other species, the females form huge co-operative nests of interlaced twigs lined with green
  leaves in trees, wherein each deposits some five bluish eggs with a chalky incrustation, amounting
  in all to twenty or more. Around or upon these structures they sit in company. Bold but wary, the
  Anis flit from bush to bush, or creep and jump about the branches, uttering a mewing sound or a
  sharper double cry. They are often mobbed by other birds. Flocks gather in wooded or marshy spots,
  and feed on insects, berries, lizards, and so forth; occasionally digging for their prey, or
  picking the ticks off cattle.</p>

  <p><i>Guira piririgua</i>, of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, is brown and buff above with darker
  streaks, and buff below, the back and tips of the lateral rectrices being white. From the
  similarity of habits to <i>Crotophaga</i> it is termed the White Ani in Brazil. Flocks draw near
  the houses in winter, and sit miserably huddled together on the trees; the note is a long
  disyllabic whistle, or in the young an hysterical laugh. Usually each pair makes a rough nest of
  twigs and leaves, laying six or seven pale blue eggs with reticulated chalky coating; though
  fourteen have been recorded.</p>

  <p>Fam. II. <b>Musophagidae.</b>&ndash;The Plantain-eaters are striking birds, peculiar to the
  Ethiopian Region, without Madagascar. They have large eyes and long necks; while the bill, though
  small in <i>Gallirex</i>, is generally stout and broad with compressed or rounded culmen and
  serrated margin, and in <i>Musophaga</i> expands into a broad frontal plate behind. The feet are
  semi-zygodactylous, with reversible outer toe and strong claws; the robust metatarsi are
  scutellated anteriorly and coarsely granulated posteriorly. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page360"><span class="smaller">{360}</span></span>The wings are rather short and round, with
  ten primaries and twelve or thirteen secondaries; the rounded tail of varying length has ten
  rectrices. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the tongue sagittate&ndash;with
  bristly apex in <i>Gallirex</i>; the nostrils&ndash;hidden in <i>Turacus</i>&ndash;are usually
  oval, but are linear in <i>Schizorhis</i> and <i>Gymnoschizorhis</i>; the aftershaft is large; the
  nestlings lack down. The red or grey orbits are naked, save in <i>Schizorhis</i>; in
  <i>Gymnoschizorhis</i> the cheeks and throat are bare and blackish.</p>

  <p>The six genera comprise two dozen or more species from about thirty to fifteen inches in
  length; the general coloration being metallic blue and green or greyish-brown, usually varied with
  crimson, and in the large <i>Corythaeola</i> with yellow; all have erectile crests of different
  sizes, except <i>Musophaga violacea</i>. The bill is red, yellowish, or black, the feet are black.
  The sexes are alike, the young duller. The red feathers yield a peculiar pigment, containing
  copper, called Turacin, which is reducible to a powder; this is so soluble that the colour is
  washed away during rain or in a bath, though regained subsequently.<a id="NtA_219"
  href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Plantain-eaters are found in pairs, or in small flocks of four to ten, over wooded country near
  inland or tidal waters, reaching an altitude of some ten thousand feet. The tops of high trees are
  <span class="pagenum" id="page361"><span class="smaller">{361}</span></span>a favourite haunt, but
  they are not uncommonly seen amongst the tangled creepers below, flitting from shrub to shrub with
  undulating flight when disturbed, and alighting with crest erect and up-turned tail. Of some
  species the flight is clumsy and jerky, of others light and graceful; at times they hover in the
  air with outspread wings and tail, at times they sport and hop among the branches, expanding and
  depressing the rectrices. Familiar yet extremely shy and restless, these birds, when wounded, are
  particularly hard to secure, as they run with great swiftness, and even take refuge in holes in
  trees. During rain or in the mid-day heat they rest quietly on some bough, but at other times are
  usually noisy, their harsh reiterated screaming or ringing notes being varied by a cat-like mewing
  or dove-like sound. The food consists of bananas, tamarinds, papaw-apples, and other fruits, with
  insects, worms, caterpillars, molluscs, or even small birds. They are occasionally mobbed by their
  kin, as Cuckoos are. Though some species have been asserted to breed in holes, <i>Schizorhis
  concolor</i> makes a flat nest in trees, and <i>Gymnoschizorhis leopoldi</i> a loose platform of
  thorny twigs and roots, both species laying three round greenish- or bluish-white eggs. The flesh
  is considered a delicacy by the natives.</p>

  <p><i>Turacus</i> (<i>Corythaix</i>) <i>fischeri</i> of East Africa is green, washed with blue on
  the wings and tail, having a crimson crest tipped with black, a crimson hind neck with white nape,
  a blackish lower chest and abdomen, and black cheeks margined above and below with white; the
  remiges are crimson, edged with black, the bare orbits red. <i>T. corythaix</i> is called the Lory
  in South Africa. <i>Musophaga violacea</i> of West Africa is glossy violet-blue with darker tail,
  the crown and hind-neck being covered with short, hairy, crimson feathers and partially outlined
  with white; the chest is greenish, the frontal plate yellow; the wing-quills and orbits are as in
  <i>T. fischeri</i>. <i>Schizorhis concolor</i> of South Africa is nearly uniform ash-coloured;
  <i>Gymnoschizorhis personata</i> of Shoa is greyish-brown with paler crest, whitish head and neck,
  blackish naked cheeks and throat, and dirty green breast.</p>

  <p>The remarkable fossil <i>Necrornis</i> occurs in the Middle Miocene of France.</p>

  <p>Of all existing Birds the Parrots (Sub-Order <span class="sc">Psittaci</span>) are perhaps the
  most interesting to the public, being easily procurable, <span class="pagenum" id="page362"><span
  class="smaller">{362}</span></span>docile, and long-lived pets of gorgeous coloration and amusing
  habits. The red-tailed Grey Parrot of Africa (<i>Psittacus erithacus</i>) is considered the best
  talker, yet, apart from individual ability, many species of <i>Palaeornis</i>, <i>Chrysotis</i>,
  and other genera, are equally clever, if we cannot say intelligent. Professor Skeat identifies the
  name Parrot with the French <i>Pierrot</i>; but, however that may be, Indian species have been
  known in Europe since the time of Alexander the Great, and one or more African forms were kept in
  ornamental cages, and even eaten, at Rome under Nero.</p>

  <p>In default of a really satisfactory arrangement we may accept that of Dr. Gadow,<a id="NtA_220"
  href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> who agrees in the main with Count Salvadori,<a id="NtA_221"
  href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> and recognises the Family <i>Psittacidae</i>, with
  Sub-families <i>Stringopinae</i>, <i>Psittacinae</i>, and <i>Cacatuinae</i>; and the Family
  <i>Trichoglossidae</i>, with <i>Cyclopsittacinae</i>, <i>Loriinae</i>, and <i>Nestorinae</i>.</p>

  <p>There are in all about eighty genera containing some five hundred species, but the variety
  arises chiefly from colour, while the beak alone would sufficiently determine the Family. This
  feature is usually short and stout, with strongly arched maxilla and mandible, the former being
  moveable and hinged to the skull, and the latter truncated. In <i>Nestor</i> and <i>Loriculus</i>
  the curve is more gradual and the depth less; in the Cyclopsittacinae and some Psittacinae the
  bill is distinctly notched; in the Stringopinae, Nestorinae, and other Psittacinae it is grooved;
  while a file-like surface with transverse ridges, below the overhanging hooked tip, distinguishes
  the Psittacidae from the Trichoglossidae. At the base is generally a large swollen cere, or a
  similar but very narrow band in various Psittacinae; in the Platycercine group this is very small,
  and it is more or less hidden by feathers in certain Psittacinae, Cacatuinae, Cyclopsittacinae,
  and Nestorinae. The feet are permanently zygodactylous, the metatarsus being short&ndash;except in
  Ground-Parrots&ndash;compressed, and covered with rugose scales. The abbreviated rounded wings of
  the terrestrial <i>Stringops</i>, where the keel of the sternum is correspondingly reduced, are
  comparatively useless; while these members, though usually moderate, may be long, as in
  <i>Nasiterna</i> and <i>Cacatua</i>, or more acute, as in the Loriinae; the primaries are ten in
  number, the secondaries from eight to fourteen. The tail varies much, being short and square with
  projecting spiny shafts in <i>Nasiterna</i>, longer with <span class="pagenum" id="page363"><span
  class="smaller">{363}</span></span>acuminate feathers in <i>Stringops</i>, moderate in the
  Loriinae and Cyclopsittacinae, elongated and wedge-shaped in <i>Conurus</i>, <i>Ara</i>,
  <i>Psittacula</i>, and many species of <i>Palaeornis</i>, long and broad in <i>Platycercus</i> and
  <i>Cacatua</i>, and so forth. <i>Oreopsittacus</i> possesses fourteen rectrices, every other genus
  twelve; in <i>Prioniturus</i> the median pair have bare shafts and racquet-tips.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped furcula is sometimes entirely absent; a completely
  ossified orbital ring occurs in the Cacatuinae, Stringopinae, and many Psittacinae; the tongue is
  short and fleshy, being fringed in the Nestorinae, or having a brush of hairs towards the tip in
  the Loriinae and <i>Nanodes</i>; the uniquely modified syrinx has three pairs of tracheal and
  tracheo-bronchial muscles; and a crop is present. The aftershaft is large, the down of the adults
  and young is uniform, the latter being naked when hatched.</p>

  <p>The coloration is commonly gaudy, and particularly so in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page364"><span class="smaller">{364}</span></span>Macaws; yet some species are sober in tint,
  and that of the beak and feet varies considerably in different forms. <i>Stringops</i> has a disc
  of stiff feathers round the eye, <i>Nymphicus</i> and the Cacatuinae possess crests,
  <i>Deroptyus</i> broad erectile nape-plumes. Bare foreheads, cheeks or orbits, of a red, pink,
  blue, yellow, black, grey, or white hue are found in <i>Microglossus</i>, <i>Cacatua</i>,
  <i>Licmetis</i>, <i>Anodorhynchus</i>, <i>Cyanopsittacus</i>, <i>Ara</i>, <i>Poeocephalus</i>,
  <i>Psittacus</i>, <i>Coracopsis</i>, and <i>Dasyptilus</i>; while powder-down patches or tufts
  occur on the neck, shoulders, and sides of the Cacatuinae, <i>Psittacus</i>, and <i>Chrysotis</i>.
  The length varies from some thirty inches in the Great Black Cockatoo (<i>Microglossus</i>) to
  about three in the diminutive <i>Nasiterna pygmaea</i>. The name Macaw is applied to <i>Ara</i>
  and its nearest allies, Love-bird to <i>Agapornis</i> and <i>Psittacula</i>, Parakeet to
  <i>Platycercus</i> and <i>Palaeornis</i>, Lorikeet to <i>Loriculus</i>, <i>Charmosyna</i>, and
  <i>Coriphilus</i>, Lory to <i>Eclectus</i>, <i>Trichoglossus</i>, <i>Lorius</i>,
  <i>Chalcopsittacus</i>, and <i>Eos</i>, King Lory to <i>Aprosmictus</i>.</p>

  <p>Parrots usually feed and roost in company, though in <i>Eclectus</i> the habits are said to be
  more solitary; the males are, however, monogamous, each courting a single female, which twitters
  and rolls the head from side to side when love-making. The haunts include wooded districts, grassy
  plains, or even rocky hills and sandy flats; <i>Stringops</i> being almost entirely terrestrial,
  <i>Melopsittacus</i> and <i>Neophema</i> (Grass-Parakeets), with <i>Geopsittacus</i> and
  <i>Pezoporus</i> (Ground-Parakeets), being mainly so, while Cockatoos and many other forms
  habitually frequent high trees, though <i>Cacatua galerita</i>, <i>Licmetis nasica</i>, and
  several species of <i>Platycercus</i> spend much time upon the ground. Most Parrots walk with
  considerable ease, and climb well; their flight is commonly low and undulating, but is
  comparatively strong in <i>Nestor</i>, the Macaws, the Lories, and the like; the last-named climb
  less, and often hop along the ground. <i>Loriculus</i>, when sleeping, generally hangs by one
  foot. Little drink seems necessary, as the vegetable food is ordinarily succulent; plantains,
  papaw-apples, figs, and tamarinds being varied by flowers, buds, leaves, hard palm-nuts, and
  fruits of <i>Platanus</i>, <i>Casuarina</i>, <i>Banksia</i>, <i>Cactus</i>, or <i>Capsicum</i>.
  Grass-Parakeets and their nearest allies subsist almost entirely on grass-seeds and grain,
  <i>Licmetis</i> and some other Cockatoos dig for tubers and bulbs, <i>Calyptorhynchus</i> and
  <i>Nestor</i> search the bark of trees for insects, while the latter and the Loriinae suck honey
  from the flowers of <i>Phormium</i> and <i>Eucalyptus</i>. <i>Nestor notabilis</i>, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page365"><span class="smaller">{365}</span></span>the New Zealand Kea, eats
  the flesh of living sheep, an acquired taste as remarkable as it is destructive. Parrots alone
  among Birds habitually manipulate their food in their claws, these claws, moreover, greatly aiding
  them to creep about the branches or to cling to the mouth of their breeding-holes. The usual cry
  is harsh and discordant, Lories and Macaws making an especially deafening noise; but Cockatoos,
  besides their scream, utter a softer sound, <i>Loriculus</i> has a monosyllabic note,
  <i>Nymphicus</i> and <i>Melopsittacus</i> quite a pretty warble. The female hisses when caught
  upon her eggs, and in captivity many forms talk and whistle. Holes in trees, crevices in cliffs or
  caves, cavities under stones or roots, and even shallow depressions in the soil, seldom with any
  bedding, serve for a nest; the spherical or somewhat pointed eggs, which are often deposited in
  confinement, being dull white, occasionally with a greenish tinge or brownish incubation-stains.
  The larger species usually lay one, two, or three, some of the smaller as many as twelve, the size
  varying greatly (<span class="wnw">pp. <a href="#page367">367</a></span>, <a
  href="#page372">372</a>). <i>Palaeornis</i> habitually cuts a circular hole in rotten trees, and
  even bores to a depth of three feet; <i>Pezoporus</i> is said to make a mass of grass and rushes
  in tussocks, <i>Myiopsittacus monachus</i> a globular fabric with a side entrance;
  <i>Nasiterna</i>, <i>Psephotus</i>, <i>Cyanolyseus</i>, and <i>Conurus</i> will breed in holes in
  ants' nests or steep banks. The male occasionally assists in incubation, and two broods may be
  reared in a season. Small or large colonies are sometimes formed, and in both the Old and New
  Worlds large flocks seriously damage ripe maize and corn, or oranges and other fruits. The birds
  are often killed for eating, and their feathers used for ornament; for caging, they are limed,
  captured with decoys, or taken from the nest.</p>

  <p>The headquarters of Parrots are in the Australian Region and the Malay countries, which possess
  a majority of the genera and peculiar species; next follows the Neotropical Region; the Indian and
  Ethiopian are comparatively poor; the Palaearctic possesses no existing representative; and the
  Nearctic but one, <i>Conurus carolinensis</i>, which early in this century extended northwards to
  the Great Lakes, but now only inhabits Florida, Arkansas, and Indian Territory. <i>Cyanolyseus
  patagonus</i> and <i>Microsittace ferruginea</i> occur at the Straits of Magellan, <i>Poeocephalus
  robustus</i> at the extreme south of Africa, <i>Cyanorhamphus erythrotis</i> in Macquarie Island;
  while many forms occupy most limited areas, especially in the West Indies and the Pacific. Of
  <i>Coracopsis mascarinus</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page366"><span
  class="smaller">{366}</span></span>of R&eacute;union, <i>Nestor productus</i> of Phillip Island, and
  <i>N. norfolcensis</i> of Norfolk Island, only a few specimens exist, and those in collections;
  <i>Palaeornis exsul</i> of Rodriguez and <i>Conurus pertinax</i> of St. Thomas in the West Indies
  are verging upon extinction. A Macaw seems to have disappeared from Jamaica, and six Parrots from
  Guadeloupe and Martinique.</p>

  <p>The sexes of all the species described below are alike, unless otherwise stated, the young

  <p>Fam. III. <b>Psittacidae.</b>&ndash;Sub-fam. 1. <i>Stringopinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Stringops
  habroptilus</i>, the Kakapo or Tarapo of New Zealand, has sap-green upper parts, with yellow
  middles to the feathers and transverse brown markings; yellower lower surface; and browner cheeks,
  remiges, and rectrices. The soft plumage, the disc of feathers round the eye, and the nocturnal
  habits have given this bird the name Owl-Parrot. During the day it usually hides in holes near the
  ground, emerging towards evening to feed greedily on mosses, bracken, seeds, berries, such as
  those of <i>Coriaria sarmentosa</i>, and even lizards; while the companies make tracks a foot or
  more wide across the herbage. The Kakapo inhabits alpine districts or open <span class="pagenum"
  id="page367"><span class="smaller">{367}</span></span>forests; it climbs well and walks swiftly,
  but has such limited powers of flight that the natives hunt it on foot by torch-light, or with
  dogs, which are often seriously wounded by the powerful bill. The note is a croak, grunt, or
  shriek. Two or three eggs, as large as those of a pullet, are deposited in burrows under
  tree-roots or rocks, without any nest. It makes a tame and playful pet.<a id="NtA_222"
  href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Psittacinae.</i>&ndash;Of this group the nocturnal <i>Geopsittacus
  occidentalis</i> of South and West Australia, and <i>Pezoporus formosus</i> of the same countries
  and Tasmania, somewhat resemble <i>Stringops</i> in general coloration. The latter, which has an
  orange frontal band, rarely resorts to trees, but crouches, skulks, or trusts to its great running
  powers, flying at most only some hundred yards, with a rapid twisting motion. It haunts sandy
  plains or marshy districts, laying two or three eggs on a bedding of grass and rushes in long
  tussocks of herbage.</p>

  <p>Our common cage-bird, <i>Melopsittacus undulatus</i>, the Australian Grass-Parakeet or
  Budgerigar, has a yellow head, with three black cheek-spots surmounted by a blue patch; the nape,
  back, and wing-coverts are yellow with black transverse markings, the remiges brown with green
  outer webs and yellow margins, the rump and under parts green, the two long median rectrices blue,
  the lateral tail-feathers green banded with yellow. These graceful and lively little birds are
  partly terrestrial, often flocking in thousands to feed upon the seeds of grasses, while they sit
  motionless during the heat among the foliage. The flight is quick and direct; the note shrill, or
  warbling; the conduct of individuals towards one another amicably quarrelsome. From three to six
  eggs are deposited in hollow branches, with no nest. The name Grass-Parakeet is shared with
  <i>Neophema</i> of Southern Australia and Tasmania, distinguished by a blue frontal band sometimes
  extending around the eyes. <i>N. petrophila</i>, the Rock-Parakeet, breeds in holes in steep
  cliffs near water, <i>N. pulchella</i> also shewing a liking for rocks. <i>Porphyrocephalus
  spurius</i> of West Australia has a maroon crown and nape, green upper parts, black remiges with
  blue bases and primary coverts, and blue lower surface with scarlet and yellow vent. The flight is
  swift, the note clucking.</p>

  <p>Of the beautiful Australian genus <i>Platycercus</i>, <i>P. elegans</i>, also found in Norfolk
  Island, may serve as an example: it is crimson-red with black on the dorsal feathers; the cheeks,
  bend of the wing, <span class="pagenum" id="page368"><span
  class="smaller">{368}</span></span>primary-coverts, outer webs of quills and the tail being blue.
  The dozen species haunt grassy hills, feed upon seeds, berries, insects and their larvae, run
  easily, take short flights, rise with outspread tail, and lay from four to seven eggs in holes in
  trees without a nest. <i>P. eximius</i> is the Roselle Parakeet of dealers.</p>

  <p><i>Loriculus vernalis</i> is green, tinged with yellowish below and with orange on the back;
  the rump is red; the throat, the inner webs of the wing-quills, and the under surface of the tail
  are bluish. The female has little blue on the throat. The flight is rapid, but the birds are not
  shy; they are found in pairs or small flocks, and are said to suck honey from the flowers. They
  breed as does the last-mentioned species.</p>

  <p>The Ethiopian genus <i>Agapornis</i> shares with the Neotropical <i>Psittacula</i> the
  appellation Love-bird, due to their habit of sitting huddled together, their mutual caresses, and
  their intense devotion to each other. If one dies, its mate not uncommonly pines away. <i>A.
  roseicollis</i> of South Africa is green above and yellower below, the forehead being red, the
  cheeks and throat rose-coloured, the rump and median rectrices blue; the lateral tail feathers
  exhibit blue tips, red bases, and a black band. It is found in flocks near water, flying quickly,
  uttering shrill, rapid notes, feeding on berries and the like, and commonly breeding in
  Weaver-birds' nests. <i>A. cana</i> of Madagascar, introduced into the neighbouring islands, has
  the head, neck, and breast grey; <i>A. taranta</i>, of North-East Africa, the forehead red, the
  rump and tail green; <i>A. pullaria</i>, of West Equatorial Africa, the face orange-red. The sexes
  differ only in these three species, wherein the under wing-coverts are black in the male, but
  green in the female, which lacks the grey or red, and in the third case has the face
  yellowish.</p>

  <p>Two dozen members of <i>Palaeornis</i> range from Senegambia to Abyssinia, the Mascarene
  Islands, India, Ceylon, the Burmese Countries, South China, and the Great Sunda Islands. <i>P.
  eupatria</i>, the Rose-banded Parakeet or Alexandrine, and <i>P. torquata</i>, the Rose-ringed
  Parakeet, are similar species from the Indian Region; they are green, with rose-coloured nuchal
  collar, black neck-stripes, bluish median and yellow and green lateral rectrices, all tipped with
  yellow, and in the former a red wing-patch. The female shews no pink or black. These birds
  frequent both hills and plains, being often found in societies; they have a loud musical note,
  feed on fruits and grain, and lay some four eggs on the chips in a hole cut out by themselves.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page369"><span class="smaller">{369}</span></span></div>

  <p>The genus <i>Eclectus</i>, extending from the Moluccas with the Tenimber Islands to the Solomon
  Archipelago, has green males and red females. <i>E. pectoralis</i> of Papuasia is green, with red
  sides, blue remiges and lateral rectrices edged with green, and yellow-tipped tail. The female
  differs in having the head, chest, and upper parts bright red, the end of the tail lighter, the
  breast, abdomen, edge of the wing and a dorsal band blue.</p>

  <p><i>Dasyptilus pesqueti</i> of New Guinea is black, with the tail-coverts, abdomen, sides, much
  of the wings, and a lateral band on the occiput red; the crown- and nape-feathers are narrow and
  pointed, the face and throat nearly naked and black. It lives at considerable altitudes in couples
  or small companies, eating fruit, and uttering a loud, harsh cry. <i>Coracopsis vasa</i>, the Vasa
  or "loud-voiced" Parrot of Madagascar, sacred to royalty in one of the tribes, and its lesser
  compatriot, <i>C. nigra</i>, are blackish-brown, with grey wings, rump, and tail, and yellowish
  naked orbits. The small flocks are partly terrestrial, but fly high; the cry is shrill; the food
  consists of seeds and other fruits and roots. <i>C. vasa</i> has been introduced into R&eacute;union,
  <i>C. comorensis</i> and <i>C. sibilans</i> inhabit the Comoros, <i>C. barklyi</i> the
  Seychelles.</p>

  <p>That clever talker, <i>Psittacus erithacus</i>, the Grey Parrot, which ranges across Equatorial
  Africa, is ashy-grey, with black primaries, red tail, and whitish naked face. It walks well, and
  climbs admirably by the aid of its beak, flying with chattering screams at considerable
  elevations, consorting in large companies, and probably nesting in holes in trees. <i>P.
  timneh</i> is not known to talk.</p>

  <p><i>Poeocephalus robustus</i> of Southern Africa is green, with brownish head, neck, remiges and
  rectrices; it has vermilion thighs, bend of the wing, and, occasionally, forehead; and naked
  orbits. The habits call for no special mention. <i>Caica melanocephala</i> of Guiana and Amazonia
  is green, with yellow cheeks, throat, sides and tip of the tail, a rufous nuchal collar, whitish
  lower parts, black primaries margined with blue, and green and black naked orbits.
  <i>Gypopsittacus vulturinus</i> of the Lower Amazons is chiefly green, yellow feathers tipped with
  black covering the throat, and forming a band at the back of the naked but hairy black head; the
  thighs are yellow stained with red; the upper wing-coverts blue margined with green, except the
  lesser, which are orange and red; the primaries are blue and black; the secondaries greener; the
  rectrices green and yellow, tipped with blue.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page370"><span class="smaller">{370}</span></span></div>

  <p>The two score members of <i>Chrysotis</i>, commonly termed Amazons, range from Central America
  to Argentina. <i>C. aestiva</i>, not found north of Brazil, has the plumage mainly green with
  black edgings, the forehead and lores blue, the crown, cheeks, and throat yellow, the primaries
  black, blue, and green. The secondaries exhibit red outer webs, the lateral tail-feathers red
  bases and yellowish tips. Entirely yellow varieties rarely occur in the wild state, but are often
  produced artificially. These birds breed in holes in high trees, and fly in small flocks, which
  utter screaming cries, and feed on plantains, berries, oranges, and so forth.</p>

  <p><i>Psittacula</i> contains the green Love-Birds of Central and Tropical South America; they are
  sometimes tinged with yellow, and have blue on the rump and wings in the male.</p>

  <p><i>Myiopsittacus monachus</i>, the Monk or Loro, of Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina,
  is green, with grey throat, breast, and head, except the occiput; a blue tinge shewing on the
  wings, and yellow on the lateral rectrices. It is very common and tame near Buenos Aires, being
  devoted to favourite spots, and playing havoc with garden fruit, which it pecks and leaves
  hanging, while at times companies feed on thistle-seeds or devastate grain-fields. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page371"><span class="smaller">{371}</span></span>Its flight is swift but
  unsteady, with rapid strokes of the wing and folded tail; yet it mobs Birds of prey, while its
  noisy chatter disturbs the other woodland species. A nest of thorny twigs, used for shelter
  throughout the year, is usually woven round the end of some branch, and has a vestibule and an
  inner chamber, which are repaired before the thin-shelled eggs, from six to eight in number, are
  laid. Though the entrance, with its overhanging eaves, is in the side or beneath, Opossums and
  Ducks occasionally take possession. A tree may contain several of these dwellings, which often
  jointly form a mass sufficient to fill a cart, though not communicating with one another.<a
  id="NtA_223" href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> <i>Cyanolyseus patagonus</i>, of Argentina and
  Patagonia, is brownish-olive, with red on the belly, yellow on the rump and flanks, blue on the
  primaries, green on the secondaries, and a whitish gorget. The flight is strong though wavering;
  the cry loud, short, but pleasing; the food consists of shoots, buds, and seeds; the breeding
  places are holes in banks. <i>Conurus carolinensis</i>, of Florida, Arkansas, and the Indian
  Territory, is green, with paler lower parts, yellow head and upper neck, orange forehead and
  cheeks. It frequents wooded creeks or swamps, feeding on cypress-seeds, beech-mast, and so forth,
  and breeding in company in holes in trees without any nest. Nearly thirty species of the genus
  range from Mexico and the West Indies to Bolivia and Argentina, <i>C. guarouba</i> of North-East
  Brazil being yellow with green remiges, <i>C. solstitialis</i> of Guiana and Brazil mainly
  reddish-yellow with blue and green wings and tail.</p>

  <p>Of the fifteen or more large members of <i>Ara</i>, <i>A. chloroptera</i>, the Red-and-blue
  Macaw, <i>A. macao</i>, which differs in its yellow and green wing-coverts, and <i>A.
  militaris</i>, the Red-and-green Macaw, occur from Mexico and Central America to Bolivia; <i>A.
  ararauna</i>, the Blue-and-yellow Macaw, and <i>A. severa</i>, the Green-and-blue Macaw only
  extend from Panama southwards. The naked flesh-coloured face is crossed by lines of feathers,
  except in <i>A. macao</i>. The four closely allied Brazilian species of <i>Anodorhynchus</i> and
  <i>Cyanopsittacus</i>, or Hyacinthine Macaws, are almost uniform blue. The flight of these
  gorgeous birds is powerful, their note harsh and screaming, while they crush and eat hard nuts of
  various kinds.</p>

  <p><i>Nasiterna pygmaea</i>, one of some nine Pigmy Parrots, is green, with dusky markings on the
  upper surface, yellowish crown, reddish forehead and middle of the lower parts; the two median
  <span class="pagenum" id="page372"><span class="smaller">{372}</span></span>rectrices are blue,
  the rest chiefly black, with yellow spots on the outer. The female lacks the red and yellow tints.
  Small flocks of these birds frequent high trees, creeping about them with the aid of their wings
  and tails, like Tree-creepers, and at midday dozing in fancied security on the lower branches.
  They feed upon seeds, and are stated by von Rosenberg to lay two eggs, no larger than those of the
  Long-tailed Tit, in holes in trees.<a id="NtA_224" href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Cacatuinae.</i>&ndash;Of the Cockatoos, which are restricted to the Australian
  Region, the Philippine and the Sulu Islands, <i>Cacatua galerita</i> of Australia and Tasmania,
  one of the forms with narrow recurved crest-feathers, is white, with the erectile tuft and
  ear-coverts yellow, the plumage being lax and powdery. <i>C. leadbeateri</i> has a red crest
  banded with yellow and tipped with white, and a rosy tinge on the head and lower surface. Other
  species exhibit broad straight white, yellow, or red crests, <i>C. roseicapilla</i> being
  decidedly pink below and grey above. In this group the bare orbits may be blue, red, grey, or
  white. These tame and active birds love open wooded country, and often form immense flocks; they
  fly strongly, hop well, utter loud shrill screams, doze in the heat, feed on roots grubbed up from
  the ground, seeds and grain, and play havoc with crops of maize and the like. Two or three
  somewhat pointed eggs are deposited in holes in trees or crevices of rocks. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page373"><span class="smaller">{373}</span></span>The half-dozen crested members of
  <i>Calyptorhynchus</i>, which are brown or black with a greenish gloss, and a whitish, red, or
  yellow band across the lateral rectrices, have a more laboured flight and a comparatively low
  whining cry; they feed on seeds of <i>Banksia</i> and <i>Casuarina</i> and on caterpillars.
  <i>Callocephalon galeatum</i> is grey, with a scarlet head and crest. In these two Australian
  genera the supposed females exhibit yellow markings. <i>Microglossus aterrimus</i>, the Great
  Black Cockatoo of North Australia and Papuasia, is greyish-black with a long narrow crest, and
  naked red and yellow cheeks. It is a retiring bird, found in pairs among high trees in thick
  forests; the flight is comparatively weak, the note a plaintive whistle; the food consists of
  seeds of <i>Pandanus</i>, <i>Canarium</i>, palm-shoots, and the like; the egg is laid on a bed of
  twigs in a hollow tree. <i>Calopsittacus novae hollandiae</i>, the crested Australian
  Cockatoo-Parakeet, is dark grey, with yellow forehead and cheeks, orange ear-coverts, and white
  wing-patch. The female has yellow marks on the tail and under parts. By no means shy, the flocks
  feed chiefly on the ground, while individuals fly well and love perching on dead branches.</p>

  <p>Fam. IV. <b>Trichoglossidae.</b>&ndash;Sub-fam. 1. <i>Cyclopsittacinae.</i>&ndash;This includes
  <i>Neopsittacus</i> and <i>Cyclopsittacus</i> of Timor, North-East Australia and Papuasia, which
  are coloured red, green, blue, and yellow; the peculiarities of structure have already been
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>Sub-Fam. 2. <i>Loriinae.</i>&ndash;<i>Trichoglossus novae hollandiae</i>, Swainson's Lory, is
  blue, with green head and central abdomen; the remaining under parts being red, the sides, nuchal
  collar and inner webs of the lateral rectrices yellow. Flocks haunt the <i>Eucalyptus</i>-forests
  of Eastern Australia and Tasmania, uttering incessant screams, flying swiftly and directly from
  tree to tree, settling again with a dash, creeping and clinging around the branches, and
  extracting honey from the flowers with their brush-tipped tongues, besides eating seeds. From two
  to four eggs are deposited in holes in trees. The various species of <i>Trichoglossus</i> range
  from Celebes and Timor to Australia and the New Hebrides. <i>Ptilosclera versicolor</i>, of North
  and West Australia, is green, with yellowish streaks on the body, bluish cheeks and nape, red
  crown, lores and breast. <i>Coriphilus taitianus</i> of the Society Islands is dark blue, with the
  lower surface chiefly white; <i>C. ultramarinus</i> of the Marquesas shews a combination of light
  and dark blue. <i>Lorius</i> extends from the Moluccas to the Solomon <span class="pagenum"
  id="page374"><span class="smaller">{374}</span></span>Archipelago; <i>L. lory</i> of Papuasia
  being red, with black crown, blue nape, upper back, central breast and abdomen, and tip of the
  tail; while the wings and middle portion of the rectrices are green. In habits these three genera
  seem to resemble <i>Trichoglossus</i>. The members of <i>Eos</i> (Red Lory) are red, relieved by
  blue, except <i>E. fuscata</i>, which is dusky, with red and yellow markings; they extend from the
  Sanghir and Tenimber Islands and the Moluccas to the Caroline and Solomon groups.
  <i>Chalcopsittacus</i> of Papuasia has purplish-black, olive, or green species, usually varied
  with red.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Nestorinae.</i>&ndash;This contains only the genus <i>Nestor</i>, with five
  species, of which <i>N. norfolcensis</i> of Norfolk Island, and <i>N. productus</i> of Phillip
  Island are extinct, while <i>N. esslingi</i> is hardly valid. <i>N. meridionalis</i>, the New
  Zealand Kaka Parrot, is olive-brown, with reddish cheeks and collar, crimson rump, abdomen and
  under wing-coverts, brown tail and breast, and grey crown. Several races have been described,
  varying in the amount of red. The Kaka is fearless, social, sprightly, and noisy, though
  semi-nocturnal and apt to retire to the deep forest during daylight. It utters harsh rasping and
  chuckling notes, or musical whistles; while it climbs trees with the aid of its beak and feet, and
  searches the dead wood for insects. It flies in lofty circles, or at times hops about the ground;
  the food consists largely of juicy fruits, blossoms, and nectar from the Rata (<i>Metrosideros
  robusta</i>) or the New Zealand flax (<i>Phormium tenax</i>). In semi-captivity this bird is a
  good mimic and talker, but terribly destructive to furniture, clothing, and orchard produce; the
  Maories keep it as a lure, encircling the metatarsus with a bone ring fastened by a cord to the
  perch. Four oval eggs are laid in hollow trees, in crevices of rocks, or under stumps and roots,
  occasionally on fragments of bark. <i>Nestor notabilis</i>, the Kea of the south island of New
  Zealand, has olive-green plumage with blackish margins; the wings and tail are varied with blue
  and yellow, the latter having a brown subterminal band; the rump and under wing-coverts are
  scarlet. The female is duller. It frequents rugged slopes of high snowy mountains, descending to
  the lowlands in winter; the small companies soar aloft, fly from peak to peak, or search for
  insect-food among the stunted vegetation. Tame, inquisitive, and destructive, the natural habits
  and food resemble those of the Kaka, allowing for the difference of haunts; but this bird will
  scream or mew, and lays larger and <span class="pagenum" id="page375"><span
  class="smaller">{375}</span></span>rougher eggs in crevices of rocks. As is well known, the Kea
  has of recent years become carnivorous, chasing sheep and devouring their flesh. Perching near the
  tail and clinging to the wool, it digs a deep hole with its powerful beak, and apparently aims at
  the kidney-fat, the mandible cutting while the hooked maxilla ensures a firm grip. The propensity
  is said to have originated from the bird pecking at sheep-skins hanging outside country stations.
  As it sometimes necessitates the abandonment of sheep-runs, or even attacks horses, a price has
  been set upon its head.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order XIII. CORACIIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>The Order Coraciiformes contains the Sub-Orders <span class="sc">Coraciae</span>, <span
  class="sc">Striges</span>, <span class="sc">Caprimulgi</span>, <span class="sc">Cypseli</span>,
  <span class="sc">Colii</span>, <span class="sc">Trogones</span>, and <span class="sc">Pici</span>,
  and includes a large number of arboreal forms with comparatively short legs, which often nest in
  holes, and have blind and helpless young. The group coincides with the <i>Picariae</i> of Nitzsch
  and Mr. Sclater, except in so far that the former author included the <i>Psittaci</i>, the latter
  the <i>Cuculi</i>, while both kept the <i>Striges</i> separate.</p>

  <p>The Sub-Order <span class="sc">Coraciae</span> consists of the Families <i>Coraciidae</i> or
  Rollers, <i>Momotidae</i> or Motmots and Todies, <i>Alcedinidae</i> or Kingfishers,
  <i>Meropidae</i> or Bee-eaters, <i>Bucerotidae</i> or Hornbills, and <i>Upupidae</i> or
  Hoopoes.</p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Coraciidae.</b>&ndash;Two Sub-families may be recognised of these Old World birds,
  (1) <i>Coraciinae</i>, and (2) <i>Leptosomatinae</i>; the latter containing only the remarkable
  "Kirombo" of Madagascar.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Coraciinae.</i>&ndash;Most of the twenty or more species of Rollers are
  brilliant blue and green, varied with reddish, and bear a resemblance to certain of the
  Crow-tribe, especially to the genus <i>Cissa</i>. The short metatarsus, however, scutellated in
  front and reticulated behind, is a clear distinction, as in <i>Cissa</i> and so forth it is longer
  and smooth behind, with elongated scutes anteriorly. It is comparatively long in Ground-Rollers,
  but they are quite unmistakeable. The bill is strong, decurved, and slightly hooked, being broad
  and depressed in <i>Eurystomus</i>; the toes are moderately stout with curved claws, while the
  second and third are united basally; the wings are long, broad and rounded, or shorter in
  Ground-Rollers, with ten primaries and about thirteen secondaries; the twelve tail-feathers vary
  in length, five species of <i>Coracias</i> having them very long, and one spatulate. The furcula
  is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the syrinx is tracheo-bronchial, the nostrils are
  hidden by bristly feathers, the tongue is thin and horny, the aftershaft is small, while there is
  no down on adults or nestlings. The sexes are similar, the young duller.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Coracias</i> ranges over temperate Europe, all Africa, and Central and Southern
  Asia eastwards to Celebes, where <i>C. temmincki</i> alone occurs. <i>C. garrulus</i>, which
  strays to Britain, and breeds from Sweden and Omsk to North Africa and North India, has the head,
  most of the wing-coverts, and the lower surface light greenish-blue, a red-brown back, dusky and
  blue remiges, ultramarine bend of the wing and rump, and greenish <span class="pagenum"
  id="page377"><span class="smaller">{377}</span></span>tail with light blue on the lateral
  feathers, the outer pair alone having black tips. In the similar <i>C. abyssinicus</i> the two
  outer rectrices are elongated and tapering; in the more purple <i>C. spatulatus</i> they are
  cobalt-blue with black shafts produced into small racquets. <i>C. naevius</i> has an olivaceous
  back, reddish-lilac head and under parts, a white nuchal patch, white streaks on the breast, blue
  rump, bend of the wing, lateral rectrices and outer portion of the remiges. The genus
  <i>Eurystomus</i> occupies Tropical Africa, and extends from India to Manchuria, Australia and the
  Solomon Islands, occasionally reaching New Zealand. <i>E. glaucurus</i>, of Madagascar and Anjuan
  Island, is bay above and lilac below, with nearly ultramarine wings and cobalt tail tipped with
  blackish; <i>E. orientalis</i> is bluish-green, with blackish head, remiges and rectrices, some
  blue on the wing-coverts, an azure patch on the primaries, and a purple throat. <i>E.
  australis</i> is similar, and is termed the Dollar-Bird from exhibiting its circular light
  wing-patch when flying.</p>

  <p>The members of these two genera are active, noisy, and pugnacious, though shy; they are usually
  diurnal, but are occasionally observed hawking for insects at dusk; when disturbed they attempt to
  hide in some neighbouring tree, while they also roost or take refuge from the heat among the
  foliage. The flight is swift, though not sustained, the wings being closed from time to time; at
  the courting season the male darts through the air with many a turn and twist, expanding and
  contracting his tail; and both sexes have the habit of rolling or turning somersaults in their
  course, and of puffing out their cheeks and throat. The note is a harsh "rack-rack-kack" or
  "racker-racker," uttered while perched or flying; the food, largely procured when hopping on the
  ground, and frequently jerked into the air before being swallowed, consists of small reptiles,
  frogs, beetles, worms, slugs and grasshoppers, if not of grain. Rollers frequent wooded country up
  to an altitude of about two thousand feet, in pairs or moderate-sized flocks; they occasionally
  sit huddled together on some branch, but love to perch on tall bare trees or wires, whence they
  energetically challenge Hawks and Crows. The four or five oval glossy white eggs are sometimes
  laid on a mass of roots, grass, hair, and feathers, in cavities in walls or under eaves of
  buildings; but more usually with little or no bedding in holes in trees or banks. In the breeding
  season the cock summons the hen from her nest, if danger threatens, while both parents <span
  class="pagenum" id="page378"><span class="smaller">{378}</span></span>dash at an intruder, or
  settle near him, jerking the head and tail. Many adults are slaughtered for decorative
  purposes.</p>

  <p>The Ground-Rollers, <i>Atelornis</i>, <i>Uratelornis</i>, <i>Geobiastes</i> and
  <i>Brachypteracias</i>, are curious forms, peculiar to Madagascar. <i>A. pitto&iuml;des</i> has green
  upper parts with a ruddy tinge, white bars across the short primaries, a fine blue head and tail,
  except for the two brown median rectrices, and a reddish-fawn lower surface divided by a blue band
  from the white throat. <i>A. crossleyi</i> has a rufous head and black gular stripes.
  <i>Uratelornis chimaera</i> is a nearly allied form. <i>Geobiastes squamigera</i> has the upper
  back reddish-brown, the lower green; the head and under parts are buff, with black scale-like
  markings, and a black line down the crown. The primaries are brownish, the tail shews a curious
  combination of green, blue, black, and brown. <i>Brachypteracias leptosomus</i> is yellowish-green
  above, with bluish margins to the feathers, and a purplish-brown head and neck, while the brownish
  tail has a subterminal black and a terminal white bar; it is white below, banded or striped with
  chestnut and black. These forest-species are almost entirely terrestrial and crepuscular, running
  about in solitary fashion in the dusk, and carefully examining the ground for insect-food, or
  scratching for worms and the like; occasionally they fly to a low branch, jerking the tail as they
  alight. The eggs are said to be white.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Leptosomatinae.</i>&ndash;This contains only <i>Leptosoma discolor</i>, the
  Kirombo or Vorondreo of Madagascar and the Comoro Islands, which has a big crested head; a long,
  slightly hooked bill, overhung at the base by recurved loral feathers; linear nostrils, placed far
  forward and covered by a horny plate; metatarsi scutellated on both aspects; and a partly
  reversible outer toe. The wings are moderate, having ten primaries and twelve secondaries; the
  long, square tail has twelve feathers; the tongue is tapering, horny and channelled; a large
  aftershaft is present, and there is a considerable powder-down patch on each side of the rump. The
  head is grey, glossed with copper and green, the neck duller; the upper parts are shining green
  and coppery-red, the under parts grey with white abdomen. The slightly larger female is
  reddish-brown above, with buff markings and only a dull gloss; the head is chiefly black, and the
  lower surface fawn-coloured spotted with black. This curious bird is very noisy throughout the
  day, uttering its note, which resembles the <span class="pagenum" id="page379"><span
  class="smaller">{379}</span></span>syllables "tu-hou" thrice repeated, either while hovering in
  the air or while ascending or descending in vertical fashion. Meanwhile the wings are struck
  against the body, and the throat puffed out like a bag. It is found in the forests in flocks of
  about a dozen, perching and squatting lazily on the branches, and scarcely moving when its
  neighbours are shot; the food consists mainly of grasshoppers, chamaeleons, and lizards; the nest
  is said to be made of rushes and placed in holes, the eggs to be white. One female is often
  accompanied by several males. The Malagasy consider that the "Re&ograve;" brings ill-luck, and make it
  the theme of various tales and chants.<a id="NtA_225" href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fam. II. <b>Momotidae.</b>&ndash;The Motmots and Todies fall naturally between the Rollers and
  Kingfishers, but are also closely connected with the Bee-Eaters, which do not occur in the New
  World. They compose the Sub-families (1) <i>Momotinae</i> and (2) <i>Todinae</i>, the former
  ranging from South Mexico and the Antilles to Paraguay, while the latter are restricted to the
  Greater Antilles.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page380"><span class="smaller">{380}</span></span></div>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Momotinae.</i>&ndash;Motmots have loose-webbed green, blue, cinnamon, and black
  plumage; the sexes being barely distinguishable, and the young similar to the adults, but with
  less developed tail. The length varies from six and a half inches to twenty. The head is generally
  rather narrow; the bill is Crow-like, with a few rictal bristles, and has the margins of the
  mandibles more or less serrated; in <i>Prionirhynchus</i> it is unusually broad and strongly
  keeled. The scutellated metatarsus is of no great length, the third digit being united to the
  fourth for about a third of its extent; the wings are rather short and rounded, with ten primaries
  and eleven secondaries. The tail-feathers are generally twelve, though <i>Baryphthengus</i> has
  only ten; they are very distinctly graduated, as is well seen from beneath, the median pair being
  much elongated with racquet-tips, except in <i>Hylomanes</i>, <i>Aspatha</i> and
  <i>Baryphthengus</i>. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the tongue is long,
  thin and frayed out towards the apex into laminae which point forwards; the syrinx is
  tracheo-bronchial; the aftershaft is small; while neither adults nor nestlings possess down.</p>

  <p>Motmots are not shy birds, though they inhabit dense forests and seldom visit the outskirts;
  they prefer the vicinity of streams, where they may be seen, solitary or in pairs, flitting before
  the traveller from tree to tree, or sitting motionless on the lower branches, whence they make
  sudden dashes to secure their prey. This consists of insects caught in the air, small reptiles, or
  fruit; but in captivity they will eat bread, raw meat, small birds and mammals, often rapping live
  creatures on the ground or on their perch before swallowing them, as is done by Todies,
  Kingfishers, and Hornbills. The flight is brief, while the short legs are ill-adapted to the
  ground. The long, soft, "flute-like" note recalls that of the Hoopoe, and may be syllabled Hu-tu,
  this being a native name in some parts; it is most commonly heard at dawn, while the bird's habit
  of jerking its tail up and down as it utters each syllable is comparable to that of Barbets and
  Toucans. Three or four round, creamy-white eggs are deposited, without any nest, in holes in trees
  or banks, probably bored by the birds themselves; both sexes being said to incubate in turn.
  Motmots with racquet-tipped rectrices have been shewn to produce that shape by nibbling off the
  vanes.<a id="NtA_226" href="#Nt_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Urospatha martii</i>, ranging from Costa Rica to Amazonia, is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page381"><span class="smaller">{381}</span></span>oil-green above, with a blue tinge on the
  blackish primaries and the end of the tail, the two median rectrices being much elongated and
  having terminal blue racquets; the under parts and head are cinnamon, the cheeks black, while a
  tuft of long black feathers adorns the neck below. <i>Eumomota superciliaris</i> of Central
  America is green above, with cinnamon mantle and blue remiges and rectrices tipped with black, the
  two median tail-feathers having elongated bare shafts with broad racquet-tips, half blue and half
  black. On the sides of the head are black bands and light blue eyebrows, while the throat is black
  with long blue lateral feathers, and the abdomen chestnut. <i>Momotus brasiliensis</i>, extending
  from Guiana to Northern Brazil, is somewhat similar in colour, but has little red on the back; the
  head is cobalt-blue with black on the crown and sides; the under parts are green with a rufous
  tinge. The long throat-feathers are black with light blue edges. <i>Aspatha gularis</i> of
  Guatemala is bright green above, and has a yellowish breast; the abdomen and throat are pale blue,
  with a black tuft at the base of the latter; the sides of the head are reddish-fawn with black
  ear-coverts. The tail is normal.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Todinae.</i>&ndash;This includes four diminutive species of the genus
  <i>Todus</i>, structurally resembling the Motmots; the tail, however, being short and square, the
  wings abbreviated with only ten secondaries, the beak flattened and but faintly serrated, and the
  rictal bristles well-developed. The long metatarsus is <span class="pagenum" id="page382"><span
  class="smaller">{382}</span></span>covered with one scale; the marginal laminae of the tongue
  point backwards.</p>

  <p>Todies frequent hilly districts and woods, and especially the vicinity of ravines, being very
  active on their feet, and taking short rapid flights from branch to branch when disturbed. They
  used to be considered close allies of the Flycatchers, probably owing to their habit of darting
  out upon their prey from some branch, to which they return immediately. They sit with upturned
  bill and head drawn in, their wings vibrating and their plumage puffed out, and when thus perched
  they are so unsuspicious that they may sometimes be caught with a butterfly-net, or even with the
  hand. The pugnacious males chase each other, clattering their bills, and, while courting, ruffle
  themselves up and droop their wings. The three or four globular white eggs are laid in a hole low
  down in the face of some bank, which is excavated to a considerable depth and commonly turns at
  right angles; the terminal chamber usually containing a slight nest of fibres, grass, moss, or
  cotton. In captivity Todies make engaging pets.</p>

  <p>The coloration is green, with a bright red throat, yellowish-white or pinkish under parts, and
  yellow, green, or pink feathers on the flanks. The bill is dull red. <i>Todus viridis</i> inhabits
  Jamaica; <i>T. subulatus</i> Hispaniola; <i>T. multicolor</i>, which has a blue spot on each
  cheek, Cuba; <i>T. hypochondriacus</i> Porto Rico. The length varies from three and a half to four
  and a half inches.</p>

  <p>Fam. III. <b>Alcedinidae.</b>&ndash;The Kingfishers, with the Sub-families (1)
  <i>Halcyoninae</i>, or Wood-Kingfishers, and (2) <i>Alcedininae</i>, or Water-Kingfishers, are
  remarkable not only for the aberrant species found among them, but also for their peculiar forms
  and particularly brilliant colours, at once strikingly contrasted and tasteful. The head looks
  disproportionately large, an appearance often heightened by the crest and the long, stout bill.
  This feature in the Alcedininae is compressed and sharp-pointed, with keeled culmen and upcurved
  genys; in the Halcyoninae it is broader and rounder, and sometimes grooved. In <i>Syma</i> the
  maxilla is <span class="pagenum" id="page383"><span class="smaller">{383}</span></span>serrated,
  as in the Momotidae; in <i>Carcineutes</i> and <i>Dacelo</i> it exceeds the mandible, and in
  <i>Melidora</i> it is hooked. The feeble metatarsi are scutellated or rarely reticulated; the
  third and fourth toes are joined for most of their length, the second and third for one joint, all
  being broad below; the claws are sharp and curved. <i>Ceyx</i> and <i>Alcyone</i> have the second
  digit aborted. The wings are short and rounded, yet powerful, the primaries being eleven in
  number, with the outer much reduced, the secondaries from eleven to fourteen; the tail is commonly
  abbreviated, but in <i>Tanysiptera</i> has a median pair of greatly elongated racquet-tipped
  feathers; that genus, moreover, possesses but ten rectrices instead of twelve. The furcula is
  <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the syrinx is tracheo-bronchial, there is no aftershaft,
  the adults are uniformly downy, the nestlings are naked. The tongue is rudimentary, though said to
  shew an approach to that of the Motmots in <i>Pelargopsis</i>. The sexes may be similar or
  dissimilar, even in the same genus; the young are like their parents, or somewhat duller. The
  colours of the Family are most variable, a combination of blue, green, and chestnut being
  frequent, while almost uniform red, or black and white, are not uncommon; the beak may be black,
  red, yellow, or parti-coloured. About twenty genera, with some hundred and fifty species, occupy
  nearly the whole globe, though by far the greater number are found from Celebes to Papuasia, while
  <i>Ceryle</i> alone is American.</p>

  <p>The habits in the Family are as diverse as the styles of plumage. The Water-Kingfishers love
  shady haunts by quiet lowland streams, where the fishes which form their chief diet abound; in
  such situations they may be seen sitting patient and motionless on some favourite overhanging
  bough or projecting stone, from which they dart out like an arrow upon their prey. If successful,
  they return immediately to their perch, on which they beat the fish before jerking it down the
  throat. At other times they hover over the water with vibrating pinions, or dive perpendicularly
  with closed wings. They are not, however, entirely piscivorous, but eat insects and small
  crustaceans, especially when they seek the sea-shore, as do several species of <i>Halcyon</i>,
  <i>Alcedo</i>, and <i>Ceryle</i>, including our native Kingfisher, chiefly towards winter. In
  tropical countries reeds and sugar-canes serve for perches. The flight is straight and quick, but
  not long sustained; the note is either high-pitched, and of two or three syllables, which may be
  <span class="pagenum" id="page384"><span class="smaller">{384}</span></span>likened to
  "tit-it-it," or is loud and harsh; it is most frequently heard as the birds skim over the streams
  in the anxious time of breeding, while the young have similar cries, and are very noisy just
  before leaving the nest, which they render extremely foul. The eggs are laid in holes in
  perpendicular river-banks, disused gravel-pits and the like, or even in cavities in walls or
  rotten stumps, the circular tunnel usually penetrating to a depth of two or three feet, and
  forming an enlarged terminal chamber. The number of eggs varies from four to ten in different
  species; they are round, white, glossy, and thin-shelled, and look very pink when they are fresh;
  they usually lie on a bed of fish-bones, consisting chiefly of vertebrae, not uncommonly deposited
  before laying begins. <i>Ceryle rudis</i> is stated to make a nest of grass, <i>C. amazona</i> one
  of sticks and straw, the former at times breeding in colonies. The male has been known to assist
  in incubation, which lasts a fortnight or more; while two broods are occasionally reared in the
  season, especially in warmer climates. The Wood-Kingfishers prefer shady forest-regions, not
  necessarily near water, but also frequent the vicinity of houses; their food consists of insects
  caught in the air, caterpillars, reptiles, frogs, crustaceans, worms and molluscs, though they
  occasionally eat fish. The nests, placed in holes in trees or banks, are said in some cases to be
  of a few straws, dry leaves, or moss. The genus <i>Dacelo</i> and its allies, including the
  largest forms of the Family, are natives of Australia and New Guinea, where they often inhabit
  very dry situations. They will even eat small mammals or birds, bruising them before deglutition,
  and lay two or three white eggs in holes in trees without any nest. The note is an extraordinary
  loud gurgling or barking sound, from which they are called "Laughing Jackasses."</p>

  <p>Kingfishers are difficult to keep in captivity, while hard frosts cause much mortality, though
  the use of the feathers for artificial flies or for ornament adds to the scarcity. The males are
  at times very pugnacious. Many fables are connected with the Family; for instance, <i>Ceyx</i> and
  <i>Alcyone</i> were said to have been changed by Zeus into Kingfishers, while Aeolus, father of
  Alcyone, kept the weather calm in midwinter (the fourteen halcyon days), when the birds formed a
  floating nest upon the deep. A dried specimen, if hung up, was supposed to act as a weathercock
  with its bill, as Shakespeare intimates.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Halcyoninae.</i>&ndash;<i>Tanysiptera sabrina</i> of the Moluccas, one of the
  members of a large and very beautiful genus, is white, except for the crown and wing-coverts,
  which are bright blue, and the cheeks, nape, remiges, upper back and scapulars, which are
  bluish-black. The two median rectrices have bluish shafts with white racquet-tips; the bill is
  red. <i>T. nympha</i> of New Guinea differs in its blue tail, vermilion rump and under parts.
  <i>Cittura cyanotis</i> of Celebes has a rufous head and chestnut tail, a brown back with
  partially buff scapulars, bluish-black wings with blue coverts, a blue eye-streak (black in the
  female), a lilac under surface, and a dark red bill. <i>Halcyon coromandus</i> of Eastern Asia is
  brown with a lovely lilac tinge above and a sky-blue rump, the lower parts being orange-rufous,
  and the bill red. <i>H. cyaniventris</i> of Java is rich blue above; the head and wing-coverts are
  mainly black, the lower parts ultramarine, the throat and cheeks rufous, extending as a collar to
  the nape; the bill is dark red. <i>H. semicaeruleus</i> of Arabia, West and East Africa, has a
  whitish head and under parts, with a chestnut <span class="pagenum" id="page386"><span
  class="smaller">{386}</span></span>abdomen; the upper parts are black, with azure lower back, tail
  and wing-quills, the bill is red. <i>H. saurophagus</i> of Papuasia and the Moluccas is blue, with
  white head and under surface, and black bill. <i>H. nigrocyaneus</i> of the former region is black
  and blue, with white throat, pectoral band and dorsal markings, the bill being black. The female
  is whiter below. <i>H. lindsayi</i> has dingy green upper parts with buff spots, and a black
  eye-stripe surmounted by an azure band, both of which extend round the back of the head; the neck
  and throat are cinnamon divided by a blue stripe, the under parts white mottled with green; the
  bill is black. The blue parts are green in the female.</p>

  <p><i>Dacelo gigas</i>, the "Laughing Jackass" or "Settlers' Clock" of Australia, is mainly brown
  above with a white stripe on each side of the head; the tail is rufous and black, the rump of the
  same colour in the female, greenish-blue in the male; the lower surface is dirty white, the bill
  blackish. <i>Clytoceyx rex</i> of New Guinea has an immensely thick, blunt, and rather short bill;
  it is brown above, with a rufous collar, blackish back and neck-stripes, light azure rump,
  greenish tail and wing-quills; below it is light chestnut with white throat. <i>Carcineutes
  pulchellus</i> of the Malay countries, Sumatra, and Java has the forehead, cheeks, and collar
  chestnut, the crown azure, the upper parts black with blue and white bands, the under parts rufous
  with white throat, the bill red. The female is rufous with black bars above, and white with black
  spotting below. <i>Syma torotoro</i> of Papuasia is greenish, with blue tail and rump,
  orange-rufous head and under parts, and a black collar. The crown is black in the female. The
  serrated bill is yellow. The genera <i>Ispidina</i> and <i>Ceyx</i> furnish the pygmies of the
  Family, varying from about four to six inches in length; the coloration in the former is usually
  blue and black above and chestnut below, with a red bill; but <i>I. madagascariensis</i> of
  Madagascar is entirely rufous, except for some white on the neck and lower surface. <i>C.
  euerythra</i>, of the Malay countries and the Philippines, which is red with a lilac tinge above,
  has several similar congeners; here again, however, blue, black, and orange are not uncommon
  hues.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Alcedininae.</i>&ndash;<i>Alcyone azurea</i> of Australia has dark azure-blue
  upper parts, reddish-orange lower surface with lighter throat, and a whitish patch on the sides of
  the neck. <i>Corythornis cristata</i> is ultramarine with light chestnut under <span
  class="pagenum" id="page387"><span class="smaller">{387}</span></span>parts, the crest being green
  with black transverse stripes, and the bill black. <i>Alcedo ispida</i> of Britain, the whole of
  Europe, and the greater part of Asia, has greenish-blue upper parts, brighter blue head and tail,
  chestnut under parts and broad eye-streak, white throat and patches at the side of the neck, and
  black bill, often orange at the base. <i>A. beryllina</i> of Java and Lombok differs in being
  entirely greenish-blue above, and white with a blue chest-band below. <i>Ceryle</i> is the sole
  genus found in the New World, though it occurs also in South-East Europe, most of Asia and Africa;
  <i>C. alcyon</i>, the Belted Kingfisher, alone reaches the Northern United States and Canada. The
  half dozen large crested species are generally black and white, relieved by chestnut or grey, but
  <i>C. amazona</i> and its nearest allies are dull green above.</p>

  <p><i>Pelargopsis gurial</i> of India and Assam, one of the "Stork-billed Kingfishers," has a
  brown head, yellowish-fawn collar and under parts, dull green mantle and tail, greenish-blue lower
  back, and red beak.</p>

  <p>Fam. IV. <b>Meropidae.</b>&ndash;The Bee-eaters are extremely brilliant and graceful birds,
  which range over the temperate and tropical portions of the Old World, being especially plentiful
  in the Ethiopian Region, and somewhat less so in the Indian. The Palaearctic countries possess
  only four species, but Celebes alone has three, one of which (<i>Merops ornatus</i>) extends
  through the Moluccas to Papuasia and Australia.</p>

  <p>The bill is long and gradually curved, with a culminar ridge and deflected mandible, the
  maxilla being grooved and more arched in <i>Nyctiornis</i>. The short, stout metatarsus, which is
  weaker in <i>Merops</i>, is scutellated anteriorly and reticulated posteriorly; the abbreviated
  toes&ndash;rather longer in <i>Nyctiornis</i>&ndash;have slender curved claws, and are united in
  the case of the third and fourth to the last joint, in the second and third to a less extent. The
  usually short and rounded wings are long and pointed in <i>Merops</i> and <i>Dicrocercus</i>; the
  primaries number eleven, or ten in <i>Nyctiornis</i>, and the secondaries twelve or thirteen. The
  tail of twelve rectrices is even in <i>Melittophagus</i> and <i>Nyctiornis</i>, deeply forked in
  <i>Dicrocercus</i>, and square with two elongated and tapering median feathers in <i>Merops</i>
  and <i>Meropogon</i>. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the tongue is
  lanceolate, the nostrils are concealed by dense feathers in <i>Nyctiornis</i> and
  <i>Meropogon</i>; <span class="pagenum" id="page388"><span class="smaller">{388}</span></span>the
  syrinx is tracheo-bronchial, the aftershaft is rudimentary; while there is no down in adults or
  nestlings.</p>

  <p>The flight of Bee-eaters is rapid and Swallow-like, and they have a habit of sitting on dead
  branches or even upright sticks, from which they dart in pursuit of their prey, to return again
  promptly after the manner of Flycatchers. They skim actively over the surface of the earth, sail
  aloft in circles, or float with slightly upturned wings in the air; while they rest among the
  foliage at mid-day, and not uncommonly roost in a row on some branch at night. Occasionally they
  may be seen dusting themselves like Larks. <i>Nyctiornis</i> is less energetic, and loves dense
  forest-shades or woods of lofty trees, as does <i>Meropogon</i>; but the other forms prefer more
  open country, and frequent the neighbourhood of swamps or rivers, as well as arid districts.
  <i>Merops</i> is constantly seen in flocks, <i>Melittophagus</i> less often; <i>Nyctiornis</i>,
  with rare exceptions, lives singly or in pairs. The last-named sometimes will not stir even when
  shot at, and none of the Family are by nature shy. The note is, according to circumstances, a loud
  harsh whistle or a soft flute-like sound; but <i>Nyctiornis</i> utters a deep croak, ending in a
  churring noise, puffing out the gular plumes meanwhile and nodding the head up and down. The birds
  are not ordinarily noisy. It is when hawking in the air that the brilliant colours are most
  strikingly displayed, the snap of the bill being at such times distinctly audible; insects are
  also picked off the backs of cattle, and, more rarely, captured on the ground; while <i>Merops
  philippinus</i>, and no doubt other species, bruise their prey against their perch. The name
  Bee-eater is well deserved, for in Spain <i>Merops apiaster</i> is a perfect pest to the
  bee-keeper, catching the workers as they enter and leave the hives. The indigestible portions of
  the food are cast up as pellets, often found in the nest. The four to six round, glossy white eggs
  are deposited in holes in banks, or even in tunnels bored vertically downwards in level ground,
  which extend to a depth of from three to ten feet. <i>Merops superciliosus</i> and <i>M.
  nubicus</i> alone are said to make a slight nest of straw and feathers, the members of this genus
  and of <i>Melittophagus</i> often forming large colonies. The flesh is palatable, while the
  plumage is in great request for decorative purposes.</p>

  <p>The sexes are similar, the young duller, with the rectrices <span class="pagenum"
  id="page389"><span class="smaller">{389}</span></span>never much elongated; <i>Meropogon</i> and
  <i>Nyctiornis</i> have the gular feathers broad and lengthened into a tuft.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Family contains five genera with some thirty-five species, varying in size from fourteen
  inches in <i>Merops natalensis</i> to about six and half in several forms of <i>Melittophagus</i>.
  <i>Nyctiornis amictus</i>, of the Malay countries, is green, with lilac forehead and crown,
  scarlet cheeks and throat-tuft, and a few greenish-blue plumes at the base of the bill.
  <i>Meropogon forsteri</i> of Celebes is also green, but has the crown, gular plumes and breast
  cobalt-blue, the occiput and nape brown, the abdomen dusky, and the lateral tail-feathers
  reddish-brown margined with green. <i>Merops apiaster</i> has ruddy-brown head, neck, upper back,
  and broad alar bar, buff lower back, green wings and tail with black tips to the long median
  rectrices, light blue upper tail-coverts, pale green and white forehead, black ear-coverts, and
  bright yellow throat, divided from the greenish-blue under parts by a black band. It not
  unfrequently visits Britain&ndash;as the Blue-tailed Bee-eater, <i>M. philippinus</i>, is said to
  have done once&ndash;and ranges from South Europe to Central Asia and North Africa, wintering in
  North-West India and South Africa. <i>M. viridis</i>, extending from Senegambia to North-East
  Africa and Cochin China, is yellowish-green, with a rufous tint on the hind-neck, much buff on the
  wing- and tail-quills, a black band washed with blue on the fore-neck, and some blue and black on
  the face. <i>M. nubicus</i> of the northern half of the Ethiopian Region has crimson-pink upper
  parts, blue-green head and throat, light blue rump and abdomen, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page390"><span class="smaller">{390}</span></span>rose-pink breast, black markings on the
  sides of the head, and black tips to the remiges and rectrices. <i>Melittophagus gularis</i> of
  West Africa is glossy black above, with bright blue on the forehead, rump, wings and median
  tail-feathers; the throat is crimson, the lower surface black with blue streaks; the wing-quills
  are for the most part rufous margined with black.</p>

  <p>The Old World Families Bucerotidae and Upupidae are united under the latter appellation by Dr.
  Gadow,<a id="NtA_227" href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> who recognises the Sub-families
  <i>Bucerotinae</i> or Hornbills, <i>Upupinae</i> or Hoopoes, and <i>Irrisorinae</i> or
  Wood-Hoopoes; but the two aforesaid groups should decidedly be kept separate.</p>

  <p>Fam. V. <b>Bucerotidae.</b>&ndash;The Hornbills derive their name from the immensely developed
  bill and casque, or helmet, found in such forms as <i>Buceros</i> (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page395">395</a></span>), though the excrescence in <i>Aceros</i> and some species of
  <i>Lophoceros</i> is rudimentary. It may be mentioned that the huge beak of the Toucans denotes no
  affinity to this group. The casque&ndash;open in front in <i>Bucorvus</i>&ndash;is more or less
  filled with cellular bony tissue, or with an almost solid mass of bony columns in
  <i>Rhinoplax</i>; the mandibles are occasionally serrated. The metatarsi are short, save in the
  terrestrial <i>Bucorvus</i>, and are rough and scaly; the toes have broad flat soles, the second
  and third being united for one phalanx, the third and fourth still further. The powerful wings
  have eleven primaries, and from ten to sixteen secondaries, while the under coverts do not
  perfectly cover the base of the quills. The tail has ten rectrices and is usually long, though
  shorter in <i>Bucorvus</i>; it is either square or graduated, and has the two median feathers much
  elongated in <i>Rhinoplax</i> and <i>Ortholophus</i>. The furcula is <span class="sans
  fwb">U</span>-shaped, the tongue rudimentary; the aftershaft is wanting; there is no down on the
  adults or callow young; and the eyelashes are prominent, a rare feature among birds. In most forms
  the atlas (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page5">5</a></span>) fuses with the axis.</p>

  <p>These arboreal birds, termed "Calaos" in French, frequent deep tall jungle or cultivated
  districts near rivers, up to five thousand feet; most, if not all, of the species descending from
  the trees in the morning and evening, when they have been observed bathing in streams, and digging
  up loose soil with their beaks. <i>Bucorvus</i> spends much of the day upon the ground searching
  for food.</p>

      Female and young. (From <i>Malay Archipelago</i>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The flight, often prolonged to considerable distances, is heavy and slow, the unwieldy body
  acting as a great drag, though counterbalanced by the pneumaticity, or air-containing nature of
  the bones, which is perhaps greater in Hornbills than in any other birds. On the wing a sound is
  generally produced like that of a steam-engine, possibly due to the open nature of the quills; but
  <i>Rhinoplax</i>, <i>Berenicornis</i>, <i>Anorhinus</i>, and <i>Anthracoceros malabaricus</i> are
  said to fly noiselessly. In some species the wing-action is regular; in others, rapid strokes
  alternate with sailing movements on outspread pinions; the head is usually drawn in and the tail
  depressed; while flocks proceed in single file. Individuals alight heavily, and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page392"><span class="smaller">{392}</span></span>from their bulk are
  restricted to the stronger branches, along which they shuffle awkwardly, even assisting themselves
  with their beak.</p>

  <p>Hornbills may be met with singly or in pairs, but ordinarily form parties of five or six, if
  not of larger numbers, gathering together to feed or to roost at fixed spots, which they leave
  before sunrise. They are not naturally shy, and if disturbed only resort to some neighbouring
  tree, where they may be often observed sitting on the boughs during the mid-day hours, with puffed
  out plumage, open bill, and head sunk upon the back as if overcome by the heat. From time to time
  while perched they elevate or depress the crest and utter loud yelping cries, not uncommonly
  flapping their wings and bowing their heads; when feeding they constantly chatter in chorus like
  Parrots, and vanish with shrill screams if intruders appear. The characteristic note, however, is
  a harsh, continuous sound, intermediate between the bray of an ass and the shriek of a railway
  engine; that of <i>Bucorvus abyssinicus</i> has been syllabled "h&#x016B;m-h&#x016B;m," and that
  of <i>B. cafer</i>, the "Bromvogel" of South Africa, has been said to resemble a lion's roar, and
  to be audible for a mile. All the species are apparently most noisy in the morning and evening, or
  before rain.</p>

  <p>Fruits and insects&ndash;the latter occasionally hawked for in the air&ndash;constitute the
  normal food, but the larger forms devour small mammals, birds, eggs and reptiles, with grubs,
  flowers, and young shoots; while <i>Bucorvus</i>, which feeds chiefly upon the ground, and hops
  rapidly, will eat tortoises, mandioc-roots, and so forth. Berries of <i>Strychnos</i> and figs
  seem greatly in favour. Nearly everything is swallowed entire, with a backward jerk of the head,
  animals having the life beaten out of them previously, and most substances being tossed up into
  the air. The male has a most curious habit of casting up the lining of the gizzard with its
  contents enclosed, possibly to feed the female or young.<a id="NtA_228"
  href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A hole in a tree or a cavity at the junction of two branches serves for the nest, wherein the
  hen is enclosed by a plaster of dung or like material; there, under penalty of death, she remains
  until she emerges dirty, wasted and enfeebled, when the brood is hatched. From one to four dingy
  white eggs with coarse pores are deposited upon the d&eacute;bris or a few feathers. Contrary to
  expectation, observations seem to shew that the female walls herself in; but, however that may be,
  the cock feeds her through <span class="pagenum" id="page393"><span
  class="smaller">{393}</span></span>the small opening left, and is even said to knock with his bill
  to attract her attention as he clings to the bark. He shews great anxiety about his charge, and
  the hen screams and bites if molested. Various members of the Family expand the tail and inflate
  the throat when courting; some thrive fairly well as pets; while <i>Aceros nipalensis</i> of
  India, and <i>Dichoceros bicornis</i>, the Homrai, ranging thence to the Malay countries, are said
  to be excellent eating. The latter is sacred to Vishnu; the immured female of <i>Rhytidoceros
  subruficollis</i> serves as a type of virtue to the Burmese; and natives believe that the plaster
  for the holes is composed of gum and earth from the four quarters of the globe. In South Africa
  the Fingoes think that their cattle will contract disease if Hornbills are shot; Kafirs consider
  that drought will cease if one of them is sunk under water and drowned; Ovampos pretend that the
  eggs are too brittle to be handled.</p>

  <p>Some nineteen genera may be admitted, from the Ethiopian, Indian, and Australian Regions, with
  about seventy species, more than thirty of which occur in each of the first two areas; a couple
  inhabit Celebes, and one ranges over the Moluccas and Papuasia to the Solomon Islands. None
  inhabit Australia.</p>

  <p>The somewhat scanty plumage is usually black, white, and grey; but a greenish or bluish tinge,
  or rufous heads and lower parts are not unfrequent. Crests are present, except in <i>Bucorvus</i>;
  <i>Ceratogymna</i> has a gular wattle; <i>Berenicornis</i> and <i>Ortholophus</i> exhibit long
  upcurved loral plumes; while the orbits and throat are more or less naked, and usually of
  brilliant colours, these with the bill and casque being often a distinguishing mark between the
  sexes. The last develops gradually in the duller young.</p>

  <p><i>Rhinoplax vigil</i> of the Malay countries, termed the Helmet Hornbill, has a line down the
  back and the neck naked and red. The casque is yellow in front and red behind, and is much used by
  Eastern artists for carving and making brooches. <i>Berenicornis comatus</i>, of the same
  districts, has a moderate black keeled casque, and bare blue orbits and throat. The female
  exhibits less white. <i>Bycanistes buccinator</i> of East Africa has a large blackish furrowed
  casque and purple naked areas. <i>Lophoceros nasutus</i> of North-East and West Africa, has the
  bill and rudimentary casque black, with a yellow streak on the maxilla and several oblique yellow
  ridges on the mandible, the bare orbits apparently grey. In the female the bill shews red in place
  of black.</p>

  Ceylon has a large yellow subcrescentic casque blotched with black, a bare white throat and
  blackish orbits, the latter being white in the hen. <i>Dichoceros bicornis</i> (Fig. 82) of India
  and the Malay countries has a large yellowish-red casque, hollowed and ending in two points
  anteriorly, which shews black markings in the male; the naked orbits are pinkish. <i>Buceros
  rhinoceros</i> of the Malay Peninsula and Indo-Malay Islands has a large red, orange, and black
  casque, curved up in front, and red orbits; the female having less black on the former.
  <i>Bucorvus</i> (<i>Bucorax</i>) has a large black casque, nearly or quite closed in <i>B.
  cafer</i> of South and East Africa, but open anteriorly and ridged in <i>B. abyssinicus</i> of
  North-East and West Africa. In the respective species the naked parts are red and blue in the
  male, blue and purple in the female. Some writers adopt a Sub-family <i>Bucorvinae</i> for this
  genus.</p>

  <p>The fossil <i>Cryptornis</i> of the Upper Eocene of France is referred to the Hornbills.</p>

  <p>Fam. VI. <b>Upupidae.</b>&ndash;Sub-Fam. 1. <i>Upupinae.</i>&ndash;This consists of a single
  genus with five similarly-coloured graceful species, which have the beak long and slightly arched,
  the metatarsi short and scutellated throughout, the toes rather long and the claws curved. The
  third and fourth digits only are joined at the base. The broad wing has ten primaries and an equal
  number of secondaries, the short, square tail has ten rectrices, the nestlings possess a little
  down. Otherwise the structure resembles that of Hornbills.</p>

  <p>Generally found solitary or in pairs, Hoopoes stalk proudly along the ground, nodding their
  heads, expanding and contracting their crests, and uttering the soft reiterated "hoop" or "hoo,"
  from which is derived their name. Besides probing the soil, the bird taps the ground with its bill
  or foot, and some persons think that worms are brought to the surface by the vibration; but it
  will also tap any perch, whether on branch, stump, or wall. The food consists of flies taken on
  the wing, insects generally, and worms; individuals being frequently observed climbing rocks or
  branches of trees in search of prey, and carefully examining heaps of refuse. Before being
  swallowed the larger objects are <span class="pagenum" id="page396"><span
  class="smaller">{396}</span></span>smartly rapped on some hard surface, and most are tossed into
  the air. The flight is strong, undulating, and seldom protracted, though Hoopoes often escape from
  Hawks; they can also run rapidly. The nest, placed in holes in trees, walls, or rocks, consists of
  a little straw or a few twigs, with some feathers or hair; it is always, however, marked by the
  addition of ordure to the lining, and sites are on record in coffins or decaying bodies.<a
  id="NtA_229" href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> During incubation the cock feeds the hen, who
  hardly stirs from her post; the eggs number from four to seven, and are pale greenish-blue with
  distinct pores. These birds are fond of dusting themselves in loose soil; the male is decidedly
  pugnacious, except in captivity; and the flesh is considered a delicacy in Southern Europe. Arabs
  venerate them and ascribe to them medicinal properties. Most persons are familiar with the story
  of Allah granting to Epops a golden crest, exchanged afterwards at the bird's request for one of
  feathers.</p>

  <p><i>Upupa epops</i> not unfrequently visits Britain, where it has nested on several occasions;
  it breeds from Southern Scandinavia to Northern Africa and the Atlantic Islands, migrating a
  little <span class="pagenum" id="page397"><span class="smaller">{397}</span></span>further south;
  while it extends through most of Asia and reaches Japan. The fine erectile crest, the head, neck,
  and lower parts are cinnamon-coloured; the remaining plumage is black, varied with buff and white;
  a band of the latter crosses the tail; and the head plumes are tipped with black and white. <i>U.
  marginata</i> of Madagascar has a larger outer primary and a narrower tail-band; <i>U. indica</i>,
  with darker cinnamon tints, extends from India to Hainan, and intergrades with <i>U. epops</i>;
  <i>U. somalensis</i> of Somali-Land is intermediate between the last and <i>U. africana</i> of
  South Africa, which exhibits no white on the primaries or crest. Females and young are duller and
  less crested.</p>

  <p>A fossil form, <i>Limnatornis</i>, occurs in the Lower French Miocene.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Irrisorinae.</i>&ndash;The Wood-Hoopoes, differing from their allies in the
  longer and more decurved bill, especially noticeable in <i>Rhinopomastus</i>, the long
  wedge-shaped tail, and the absence of a crest, are commonly seen in flocks of from six to eight;
  they are shy, restless and noisy, flitting from bush to bush with undulating motion and expanded
  rectrices, while they also creep about probing the crannies of the highest trees&ndash;to the
  great detriment of the tail&ndash;or search the ground for grubs and insects generally. The note
  is harsh and chattering; the nest, said to be foul like that of their allies, is placed in holes
  in trees, the eggs being apparently white. The plumage is metallic purple, blue or greenish, with
  white wing-patch and tail-markings, the females and young being less bright, with shorter
  beaks.</p>

  <p><i>Irrisor</i> occupies the Ethiopian Region, <i>I. viridis</i> and <i>I. erythrorhynchus</i>
  having the head and throat bluish-green, <i>I. bollii</i> those parts buff, <i>I. jacksoni</i>
  nearly white. Three species of <i>Scoptelus</i> inhabit North-East and West Africa, three of

  <p>The Sub-Order <span class="sc">Striges</span>, containing the natural and well-marked group of
  the Owls, was until lately usually treated as a mere Family situated next to the diurnal Birds of
  Prey (<i>Accipitres</i> of this work), whatever name or rank may have been given to the combined
  assemblage. Gradually, however, a conviction has arisen that these nocturnal&ndash;or chiefly
  nocturnal&ndash;Birds of Prey deserve a higher position than that of a Family, while Dr. Gadow, in
  the classification here mainly adopted, agrees with those who would separate them widely from
  their former associates, and places <span class="pagenum" id="page398"><span
  class="smaller">{398}</span></span>them in close proximity to the Nightjar alliance
  (<i>Caprimulgi</i>), the members of which they certainly resemble in their soft plumage, large
  eyes, and crepuscular tendencies.</p>

  <p>Fam. VII. <b>Strigidae.</b>&ndash;This, which contains all the Owls, may be divided into two
  Sub-families, (1) <i>Striginae</i> and (2) <i>Buboninae</i>.<a id="NtA_230"
  href="#Nt_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a> In the former, or Screech-Owl section,<a id="NtA_231"
  href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> the sternum has its broad keel joined to the furcula, and
  exhibits no notches behind; in the latter, containing the remaining genera, the clavicles do not
  always form a furcula, nor do they meet the sternum, which shews one or two pairs of projections
  posteriorly. In this section, moreover, there is a bony loop bridging the channel in the
  metatarsus which contains the common extensor tendon of the toes, as is the case in the Osprey.
  Pterylography would lead to the same subdivisions. Between the two groups lie <i>Photodilus</i> of
  the Indian Region, now referred to the Buboninae, and <i>Heliodilus</i> of Madagascar, which is
  classed with the Striginae.</p>

  <p>The head is large; the neck short and thin; the bill moderate in length, but stout, with a
  sharp hook at the tip; the culmen is usually curved, but is straighter in <i>Strix</i>, while the
  basal cere is more or less covered by feathering, especially in <i>Nyctea</i>. The short, strong
  metatarsi&ndash;somewhat longer in <i>Speotyto</i> and <i>Sceloglaux</i>&ndash;are flattened in
  front and covered with small scales. They are usually feathered, though in <i>Ketupa</i> and
  <i>Scotopelia</i> they are all but bare, while they are partly so in <i>Scops gymnopus</i> and
  <i>S. nudipes</i>, the two former having the toes provided with spicules below, as in
  <i>Pandion</i>. Many forms have the plumage extended as a thick covering of soft feathers or
  bristles to the claws, which are normally long, sharp, and curved, that of the middle toe having a
  serrated margin in the Striginae. The digits are padded beneath, and the fourth of them is
  reversible at will, enabling Owls to perch with either one or two toes behind. The wings are long,
  or fairly so, very broad, and more or less rounded, <i>Scops</i> and <i>Strix</i> being instances
  of greater length, <i>Bubo</i>, <i>Sceloglaux</i>, <i>Speotyto</i>, and <i>Photodilus</i> of
  shortness; the primaries number eleven and the secondaries from eleven to eighteen. The tail of
  twelve rectrices is generally short and somewhat rounded, though longer in <i>Surnia</i>. The
  large <span class="pagenum" id="page399"><span class="smaller">{399}</span></span>eyes are
  directed obliquely forwards, but those of <i>Ninox</i> are said to have a less staring look; Owls,
  moreover, have little power of turning the eye-ball, and consequently add to their grotesque
  appearance by constantly moving the head from side to side. The upper eye-lid shuts over the eye,
  and not the lower, as in birds generally; the iris is extremely sensitive, contracting and
  expanding continually. The external ear varies in an extraordinary way, the "conch," or large
  shell-like aperture, often having its ample membranous margin developed into an elevated operculum
  or flap which stretches partially or entirely down the anterior side. In <i>Asio</i> and
  <i>Syrnium</i> the ear-openings are asymmetrical, those of the former reaching nearly the whole
  height of the skull and being directed respectively upwards and downwards; in <i>Nyctala</i> this
  asymmetry extends to the bones of the skull itself. The large ear is apparently correlated with a
  keen sense of hearing in some cases, but not in all.</p>

  <p>The furcula, when complete, is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the tongue is fleshy,
  and somewhat horny below; the nostrils, placed towards the front of the cere, are rather large,
  and usually concealed by bristles; the syrinx is bronchial; the after-shaft is absent or
  rudimentary; down occurs in the adults only on the unfeathered spaces, but in the nestlings forms
  a woolly coating, which may be brown or dusky, as in the Snowy Owl, white as in the Screech-Owl,
  yellowish or grey, as in many species.</p>

  <p>The sexes are alike, the female being larger than the male. The young resemble the adults, but,
  at least in certain cases, are more rufous or buff; further information is, however, needed as to
  the successive stages. All Owls exhibit a certain similarity, while their ample plumage creates an
  erroneous impression of bulk; the feathers&ndash;most compact in <i>Surnia</i>&ndash;are soft,
  with an admixture of hairs and with weak, brittle shafts, to which facts the noiseless flight is
  largely due. An erectile tuft decorates each side of the crown in <i>Bubo</i>, <i>Asio</i>,
  <i>Scops</i>, and <i>Ketupa</i>; but the most striking outward characteristic is the ruff of
  several series of small, stiff-shafted, recurved feathers, originating from a fold of the skin
  round the cheek, which support the larger feathers of the overlying disc around the eye. The
  latter is very complete in <i>Strix</i>, <i>Syrnium</i>, and <i>Asio</i>, being in the first-named
  rather triangular than circular; but in <i>Surnia</i>, <i>Speotyto</i>, <i>Bubo</i>, and
  <i>Scops</i>, not to mention other cases, it is far less perfect.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page400"><span class="smaller">{400}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Syrnium cinereum</i>, one of the largest members of the Family, is thirty inches long,
  though <i>Bubo</i> possesses species that are perhaps more powerful; on the other hand,
  <i>Micrathene whitneyi</i> and <i>Glaucidium cobanense</i> measure about five inches. Omitting the
  white or yellowish-white forms, the coloration of Owls may be stated to be a mixture of black,
  brown, rufous, grey, yellow, and white, while barring is frequent on the wings and tail. The
  pattern is always difficult to describe, nor can more than an indication of it be given in the
  space available below. Permanent rusty-red and grey phases occur in many species, or more rarely a
  brown phase; such species as exhibit two of these being termed dimorphic, though dichromatic would
  better express the meaning. The bill is blackish, dusky, or yellowish. The moult in the Strigidae
  appears to be very gradual.</p>

  <p>Owls are an exceptionally cosmopolitan group of birds, a large proportion of the genera being
  common to both hemispheres; <i>Ketupa</i>, <i>Scotopelia</i>, <i>Ninox</i>, <i>Heteroglaux</i>,
  <i>Sceloglaux</i>, <i>Carine</i>, <i>Photodilus</i> and <i>Heliodilus</i> are, however, peculiar
  to the Old World, <i>Speotyto</i>, <i>Gymnasio</i> and <i>Micrathene</i> to the New. The
  Short-eared Owl (<i>Asio accipitrinus</i>) is found at various seasons throughout the globe,
  except, it would seem, in West Africa, Australia, the Moluccas, Papuasia, and Oceania; it occurs
  even in the Sandwich, Gal&aacute;pagos, and Falkland Islands. The Screech-Owl (<i>Strix flammea</i>) has
  an even wider range, but is not met with in Norway, the north of North America, or New Zealand.
  Authorities differ as to the genera and species to be recognised, but certainly many more of the
  latter are now known than the one hundred and ninety at which Dr. Sharpe put the total in 1875.<a
  id="NtA_232" href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The members of this Family frequent districts of the most varied description, whether they be
  wooded highlands, rocky ravines, or cultivated lowlands; the Snowy Owl (<i>Nyctea scandiaca</i>)
  nests chiefly on the fjelds and barren lands towards the North Pole; while the Burrowing Owl
  (<i>Speotyto cunicularia</i>), which is equally at home on the sandy plains of North or South
  America, is exceptional as an instance of gregarious habits in the group. The majority, being
  nocturnal, are ill at ease in sunlight, a fact which may explain the apparent discrepancy between
  their habitual shyness and their bold conduct at the nest or when wounded; many are then
  positively dangerous, and prove worse adversaries <span class="pagenum" id="page401"><span
  class="smaller">{401}</span></span>than Falcons or Eagles. In the perpetual day of the Arctic
  summer the Snowy Owl and the Hawk-Owl (<i>Surnia ulula</i>) cannot of course be nocturnal, while
  to a limited extent various species of <i>Bubo</i>, <i>Scops</i>, <i>Ninox</i>, <i>Glaucidium</i>,
  <i>Carine</i>, <i>Nyctala</i>, and <i>Asio</i> may be seen abroad in the hours of light; so that
  in many cases sight may aid in the capture of prey as much as hearing.</p>

  <p>The noiseless flight is buoyant, but usually slow and somewhat wavering, with frequent beats of
  the wing; occasionally it is more direct, and in <i>Surnia ulula</i> almost Hawk-like. Owls
  apparently prefer to perch with the first and fourth toes behind, and on a level surface to stand
  with three toes in front; their gait on the ground is awkward, and being arboreal birds&ndash;with
  the exception of <i>Speotyto</i> and <i>Sceloglaux</i>&ndash;they rarely walk to any extent.</p>

  <p>The food consists of small mammals, such as lemmings, rats, voles, and mice; of insects, with
  perhaps beetles in especial; and to a less degree of birds, reptiles, bats, worms, slugs, and
  snails. The stronger forms even capture young fawns, rabbits, hares, large grouse, and so forth,
  <i>Ninox connivens</i> being a great enemy of the young of the Koala (an Australian marsupial);
  while the Snowy, Mottled, Screech-, and Wood-Owls occasionally take fish, which, with crabs,
  constitutes the chief diet of <i>Ketupa</i>. The manner of procuring sustenance varies with the
  object sought. Insects are frequently caught upon the wing, but ordinarily the ground is quartered
  after the manner of Harriers, and a pounce made upon the prey, which is secured in the long curved
  talons. The smaller creatures are swallowed entire or carried in the bill; the bigger are
  conveyed, hanging between the feet, to some convenient spot, where they are torn to pieces and
  sometimes plucked. Bones, fur, feathers, beetles' elytra, and the like are ejected as round or
  cylindrical pellets, which commonly lie thickly around the nests or feeding-places, and clearly
  shew the nature of the food.</p>

  <p>The note varies from a loud hoot to a low, muffled sound or a clear, musical cry; the utterance
  of both young and adults being in some cases a cat-like mew, while the Screech-Owl snores when
  stationary. The "hoot" is said to be produced by closing the bill, puffing out the throat, and
  then liberating the air, a proceeding comparable to that of the Bitterns (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page88">88</a></span>). On the whole the voice is mournful and monotonous, but occasionally
  it resembles a shrill laugh. If a nest be made, it is commonly placed in a hole in a tree or on a
  ledge of rock, but many species <span class="pagenum" id="page402"><span
  class="smaller">{402}</span></span>simply deposit their eggs on the d&eacute;bris naturally found in
  cavities.</p>

  <p>To descend to a few particulars, the Snowy and Short-eared Owls, certain other species of
  <i>Asio</i>, and in some cases the Eagle-Owls (<i>Bubo</i>) breed upon the ground, often near some
  sheltering tuft, and use little or no bedding; <i>Speotyto</i> collects a mass of grass, dry
  leaves, feathers, and rubbish in burrows; the Wood-Owls (<i>Syrnium</i>), the Long-eared Owl
  (<i>Asio otus</i>), and several other forms utilize deserted nests of Pies, Crows, Squirrels, and
  the like, commonly adding a fresh lining; the first-named alternatively choose holes in trees or
  in the ground; while <i>Carine glaux</i> has been known to breed in ant-hills. The Screech-Owl
  (<i>Strix</i>) and most of the smaller members of the Family deposit their eggs in crevices in
  rocks or banks, in natural cavities in trees, or even at the junction of two large branches;
  towers, lofts, dovecots, and belfries being well-known sites for the former. Apparently none of
  the above excavate their own holes in the wood, or do more than clear them out; a few, however,
  decorate the nests they usurp with green foliage, as do so many Buzzards and Eagles. The habits
  sometimes undergo a decided change, as when the Short-eared Owl in the Aleutian Islands, and the
  Screech-Owl in Texas and India take to fairly deep burrows.</p>

  <p>The Strigidae are exceptionally early breeders; for instance, Long-eared Owls' eggs have been
  found in England at the end of February, and those of <i>Bubo virginianus</i> in that month in the
  United States; it is true the Screech-Owl is later in this country, but this does not seem to be
  the case with its American race. Where fresh sets are found late in the year, the first have
  generally been destroyed, and a second brood is uncommon, though the contrary holds true during
  vole- or lemming-plagues, when food is unusually abundant; at such times, moreover, the number of
  eggs is abnormally large for the species. The usual tale varies from two to ten, while the bigger
  forms as a rule do not deposit so many. Much has been made of the fact that the Screech-Owl (with
  the Eagle-Owl and other forms) lays at considerable intervals of time; but this is certainly not
  always true, and in many cases the varying size of the embryo is easily accounted for by supposing
  the parent to sit as soon as the first egg is deposited. On the other hand, occasional breaks
  certainly occur in the laying, and pairs of eggs are often produced almost simultaneously; yet the
  bird has <span class="pagenum" id="page403"><span class="smaller">{403}</span></span>no regular
  habit of allowing the subsequent eggs to be hatched by the warmth of the oldest nestlings; and the
  reader may be reminded that in other groups, such as the Harriers and Divers, a very similar
  inequality in the development of the eggs may be observed. Exceptionally the white shell is said
  to be tinted with blue or yellow, or to be even marked with lilac and brown in <i>Bubo
  coromandus</i>.<a id="NtA_233" href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> The shape is normally oval or
  nearly spherical, but longer or even pointed specimens are not uncommon, while the larger the size
  the less glossy is the texture. The male is generally to be found near at hand if the nest is
  disturbed, and undoubtedly assists in some cases in incubation, which lasts about four weeks. The
  hen hisses when caught in a hole, and invariably sits closely; while both parents frequently
  remain near an intruder, and "click" their beaks at him in exactly the same manner as the
  pugnacious nestlings do.</p>

  <p>Owls are constantly mobbed by other birds, especially when dazed by sunlight, the Little Owl
  being used as a lure on the Continent. They migrate to a greater or less extent, the autumnal
  visits of the Short-eared Owl being especially well-known in Britain; yet the Snowy Owl often
  remains in the far north in winter. The flesh is not generally reckoned palatable, but
  <i>Bubo</i>, <i>Asio</i>, <i>Nyctea</i>, <i>Carine</i> and <i>Scops</i> at least are eaten by the
  natives of various countries; superstition, however, usually prevents the murder of an Owl, which
  is usually supposed to entail evil, though in a few places good luck. In Andalucia the Scops- and
  Screech-Owls are believed to be the devil's birds, and to drink the oil from the lamps in saints'
  shrines; the Malagasy consider the members of the Family embodiments of the spirits of the wicked;
  and country folks' belief in their connection with death and the churchyard dates back at least to
  the time of Shakespeare, who makes one of his characters call the owl's hoot or screech a "song of
  death." Many species are well-adapted for aviaries, and breed freely; and the Little Owl
  (<i>Carine noctua</i>) has done so when liberated in Britain.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Striginae.</i>&ndash;<i>Strix flammea</i>, the nocturnal White, Screech-, or
  Barn-Owl, is orange-buff above, with brown, grey and white markings, but is white below and on the
  complete facial discs. The dark grey phase has the white parts tinged with orange and a few
  distinct blackish spots beneath. The legs are entirely, and the toes partially, covered with
  bristly <span class="pagenum" id="page404"><span class="smaller">{404}</span></span>feathers. As
  mentioned above (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page400">400</a></span>), the bird is almost
  cosmopolitan, if we disregard the sub-species proposed. It is rare in northern Scotland. It lays
  its four to six dull white eggs, without any nest, in hollow trees, crevices in masonry or rocks,
  towers, belfries, lofts, and so forth, and has been known to breed in holes in banks or cliffs in
  America, between forking branches in the Philippines, and on the ground in Madagascar. The eggs
  are not uncommonly deposited at considerable intervals. The food consists chiefly of small
  rodents, though birds, bats, insects, and even small fish are eaten; the note is a weird screech,
  while young and old make a snoring noise at the nesting place. When this bird frequents dovecotes
  it destroys the rats which prey upon the eggs and young of pigeons, and is itself practically
  harmless. According to Dr. Sharpe<a id="NtA_234" href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> the following
  may also be admitted as valid species: <i>S. novae hollandiae</i> of Australia, <i>S.
  tenebricosa</i> of that country and New Guinea, <i>S. capensis</i> of South Africa, and <i>S.
  candida</i>, the Grass Owl, ranging from India to China, Formosa, North Australia, and Fiji. <i>S.
  castanops</i> of Tasmania may perhaps be added, and <i>S. aurantiaca</i> of New Britain is
  certainly distinct, but may not belong to this genus.</p>

  <p><i>Heliodilus soumagnii</i> of Madagascar is cinnamon-rufous above, with a few black spots on
  the head, and bars on the wing and tail; it is lighter below and pinker on the face. The toes are
  bare.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Buboninae.</i>&ndash;<i>Photodilus badius</i>, found from the Eastern Himalayas
  to Ceylon, the Burmese Countries, Borneo, <span class="pagenum" id="page405"><span
  class="smaller">{405}</span></span>and Java, is a somewhat similarly coloured bird to the
  last-named, and utters a single reiterated note. The habits are unknown.</p>

  <p><i>Nyctala tengmalmi</i>, Tengmalm's Owl, inhabits the forests of Northern and Central Europe,
  Siberia, and Arctic America; it has brown upper parts barred and mottled with white, and whitish
  lower surface banded and streaked with brown; the facial discs are fairly complete, the legs
  feathered to the end of the toes. Only partially nocturnal, it utters a soft whistle or bell-like
  note, feeds on small rodents, birds, and beetles, and lays from four to six, or exceptionally ten,
  eggs in holes in trees. Its only congener, <i>N. acadica</i>, called the Saw-whet Owl from its
  grating cry, occurs in America from Mexico northwards.</p>

  <p><i>Syrnium aluco</i>, the Tawny, Brown, or Wood-Owl of Great Britain&ndash;not found in
  Ireland&ndash;ranges through most of Europe and Northern Africa to Palestine, and it is said to
  Tibet; the colour above is grey and brown, with white spots on the wing-coverts and tip to the
  tail; the lower parts being rufous-white, mottled and streaked with brown. The perfect facial
  discs are greyish, the legs are feathered to the claws. A rufous phase is even more common in this
  country. It is an arboreal and entirely nocturnal species, which makes the woodlands ring with its
  note in the autumn gloaming, and less frequently in the morning; the sound resembling
  h&#x014F;o-h&#x014F;o-h&#x014F;o-h&#x014D;o once or twice repeated, rather than the Shakespearean
  tu-whit, to-who. Surface-swimming fish vary the usual diet. From the middle of March onwards three
  or four large oval eggs are deposited in hollow trees or deserted nests of other birds; or even in
  caves, lofts, and rabbit-burrows, though trees may be near to hand; sometimes a scanty lining of
  twigs, grass, down, feathers, or fur is added. This genus, with about thirty species, extends over
  nearly the whole globe, except Madagascar and the Australian Region; some of the best known
  members being the northern <i>S. lapponicum</i>, the Lapp Owl, and its American race <i>S.
  cinereum</i>&ndash;much larger and greyer birds than <i>S. aluco</i>, with curious concentrically
  marked facial disks&ndash;and the whiter broadly streaked <i>S. uralense</i> of Northern and
  Central Europe and Siberia, which is said at times to bleat like a goat. India furnishes <i>S.
  nivicola</i> and <i>S. newarense</i> of the Himalayas, <i>S. ocellatum</i> and <i>S. indranee</i>,
  the last-named extending to the Malay Peninsula; <i>S. sinense</i> occurs in that district Burma,
  Cochin China and Java, <i>S. leptogrammicum</i> in Borneo. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page406"><span class="smaller">{406}</span></span><i>S. nebulosum</i> of eastern and <i>S.
  occidentale</i> of southern North America extend to Mexico; whence <i>S. virgatum</i>, <i>S.
  perspicillatum</i>, <i>S. albigulare</i> and other species range to the middle of South America.
  <i>S. rufipes</i> is a native of Chili and Patagonia. Finally, <i>S. nuchale</i> inhabits Western,
  <i>S. woodfordi</i> Southern and North-Eastern Africa.</p>

  <p><i>Asio otus</i>, the Long-eared Owl, is buff, streaked, mottled and vermiculated with brown
  and grey, especially on the upper parts, which appear almost brown. The buff facial discs are
  complete; the feathering of the legs extends more or less over the toes; the two long head-tufts
  are erectile. It occurs throughout Europe, in Asia ordinarily north of the Himalayas, in China,
  Japan, the Atlantic Islands, and North Africa, being replaced in America southwards to Mexico by
  the sub-species <i>A. americanus</i> (<i>wilsonianus</i>). <i>A. accipitrinus</i>, the Short-eared
  Owl, one of the most widely distributed of birds, inhabits or visits nearly the whole globe (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page400">400</a></span>). It is lighter and less streaky than the last
  form, with much shorter tufts. <i>A. mexicanus</i>, ranging from Mexico to Brazil, <i>A.
  madagascariensis</i>, peculiar to Madagascar, <i>A. capensis</i> of that island and most of
  Africa, which strays to Spain and Arabia, <i>A. stygius</i>, found from Mexico and Cuba to Brazil,
  and its Jamaican representative, <i>A. grammicus</i>, complete the genus. The last three have
  comparatively bare toes. The Long-eared Owl resembles the Wood-Owl in general habits, and even, it
  is said, breeds at times upon the earth; but it almost invariably relines deserted habitations of
  other birds or of squirrels with a scanty supply of twigs, grass, fur, down, or feathers, and lays
  from four to six oval eggs from the end of February onwards. Pies' nests are in great request,
  especially those of the preceding season. This somewhat silent species utters a single hoot, or
  else a mewing cry, often erroneously attributed to the young alone; the parents sit on the tops of
  trees when the nursery is disturbed, and click their beaks, just as the nestlings do. The
  Short-eared or Marsh-Owl makes a nest of the surrounding substances, with a few feathers, among
  heather, sedge, or marshy herbage, sometimes sheltered by some tussock or bush, and normally
  deposits from four to eight eggs; but during the vole plague on the Scottish Borders in 1890-92,
  when these birds abounded, they produced as many as thirteen each. In Unalashka a similar
  structure is made in holes in banks. Should the sitting parent be disturbed, it commonly utters a
  harsh scream, and hovers or circles around <span class="pagenum" id="page407"><span
  class="smaller">{407}</span></span>with continued cries, which summon its mate, if near; at other
  times little noise is made, though this species is unusually diurnal. If quartering the flats for
  food its flight is sufficiently powerful; but if suddenly flushed it is wavering or zig-zag, as is
  well seen in autumn, when the bird is named "Woodcock-Owl" in Britain, from its arriving at the
  same time as Woodcocks.</p>

  <p><i>Micrathene whitneyi</i>, of the South-Western United States and Mexico, is grey, mottled
  with brown and a little rufous; the lower parts being whiter, and some white also shewing on the
  nape, wing-coverts, and throat. It breeds in holes in cacti and the like. The genus
  <i>Glaucidium</i>, or Pigmy-Owl, comprises some twenty members, distributed over most of the
  globe, except the Australian Region, while one inhabits Europe. The coloration is blackish- or
  ashy-brown, greyish, or rufous; browner and redder phases often occurring in the same species. The
  upper parts exhibit the usual dark mottlings, and yellowish or white markings; the under surface
  is lighter; a whitish collar sometimes occurs above, or a dusky gorget below. The facial discs are
  rather imperfect, the toes may be thickly feathered or only hairy. The habits of <i>G.
  passerinum</i> of Northern and Central Europe are apparently representative of these forms, which
  are, according to circumstances, shy or fearless, though strong and rapacious for their size; they
  capture birds bigger than themselves, bats, rodents, moths, and large insects generally. By
  preference arboreal, and denizens of hilly woodlands, gardens, and orchards, they doze in trees
  during the day; yet they are not entirely nocturnal, and may be seen after sunrise pursuing their
  prey with rapid, jerky flight, very different to that of the more slowly-flapping crepuscular
  species. The note varies from a loud clear whistle to a short hissing or longer gurgling sound;
  the three to five roundish eggs are laid in hollow trees. The largest form, <i>G. cuculo&iuml;des</i>,
  found from the Himalayas to Siam, does not attain twelve inches (<i>G. whitelyi</i> of China and
  Japan being barely separable), while <i>G. cobanense</i> of Guatemala is only five inches long,
  and is the smallest Owl known. <i>G. radiatum</i> inhabits India, <i>G. brodiei</i> the Himalayas,
  <i>G. castanonotum</i> Ceylon, <i>G. sylvaticum</i> Sumatra, <i>G. castanopterum</i> Java, <i>G.
  pardalotum</i> Formosa, <i>G. perlatum</i> most of the Ethiopian Region, <i>G. capense</i> South
  Africa; <i>G. gnoma</i> ranges from British Columbia to Guatemala, <i>G. ferox</i> (with its
  races) from Texas to Bolivia and Brazil; <i>G. siju</i> occupies Cuba, <i>G. jardinii</i> New
  <span class="pagenum" id="page408"><span class="smaller">{408}</span></span>Granada and Venezuela,
  <i>G. pumilum</i> Brazil, <i>G. nanum</i> Chili and Patagonia.</p>

  <p><i>Sceloglaux albifacies</i>, the Laughing Owl of New Zealand, is rufous-brown, with the middle
  of the feathers dark, and a few marks of white and buff above; the tail is barred with fulvous,
  the fairly perfect facial discs exhibit radiating brown streaks; the toes are hairy. For an Owl
  this peculiar species has the head small, the wings short, and the metatarsi long; it strides
  along or hops at a considerable rate on the ground, and flies only at night, uttering a peculiar
  shrill laugh or a loud barking call-note. It is fast becoming extinct in its bleak
  mountain-haunts, where it conceals itself by day&ndash;and also nests&ndash;in dry crevices of
  rocky gullies; it lays from one to three eggs at considerable intervals, if we may judge from
  captive specimens. The female is smaller than the male, who occasionally incubates. As the Maori
  rat of New Zealand is extinct, the food now consists of the introduced <i>Mus decumanus</i>, with
  insects, birds, and so forth.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Ninox</i> the prevailing colours are grey, brown, and rufous, relieved by a
  little black and white, the question of dichromatism not being yet settled. The facial discs are
  somewhat imperfect. The thirty or more species extend from Madagascar, India, and Ceylon to Japan,
  Australia, New Zealand, and the Solomon Islands, having their headquarters in the Moluccas and
  Papuasia; but, with the exception of <i>Scops</i>, there is perhaps no group in the Family where
  the status of the members is more doubtful. They are sometimes termed Hairy or Hawk-Owls, though
  the true Hawk-Owl is <i>Surnia ulula</i>. <i>N. scutulata</i>, ranging from India to Japan,
  Formosa, Ternate and Flores, frequents forests and gardens, sallying forth at dusk, darting upon
  insects from its perch on some dead branch, uttering a reiterated double note, and laying its eggs
  on dried leaves in hollow trees. <i>N. strenua</i>, <i>N. connivens</i>, and <i>N. boobook</i> are
  Australian species, of which the first is a powerful bird with a hoarse, mournful voice, mainly
  nocturnal, but wakeful and speedy in the daytime. It frequents lonely forests and thick "brushes"
  on hills, being less widely distributed than the more diurnal <i>N. connivens</i> and <i>N.
  boobook</i>. The latter may be seen in sunlight capturing birds or insects in the woods, but the
  note of "boobook," or "buck-buck," from which it gets its native name, is only heard at night. The
  colonists compare the cry with "cuckoo," and believe that the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page409"><span class="smaller">{409}</span></span>Cuckoo visits Australia and there assumes
  nocturnal habits. The flight is rapid and Woodcock-like, the three eggs are deposited in holes in
  trees, with no nest. <i>N.</i> (<i>Spiloglaux</i>) <i>novae zealandiae</i>, of New Zealand, called
  from its cry "More-pork,"<a id="NtA_235" href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> is dark brown above
  with white spots on the scapulars and wing-coverts, and is tawny with brown streaks below. By day
  it hides in trees or crevices of rocks, and appears at dusk to prey on rats, mice, birds,
  lepidoptera, beetles, and crickets. Besides the usual note, a shrill scream or croak is not
  unfrequently heard; the young make a snoring noise, and adults click the beak when angry. Two or
  three eggs are laid in hollow trees or under boulders. Of other species <i>N. maculata</i> is
  restricted to Tasmania and Norfolk Island, <i>N. albaria</i> to Lord Howe Island, <i>N.
  obscura</i> and <i>N. affinis</i> to the Andamans and perhaps the Nicobars, and <i>N. natalis</i>
  to Christmas Island, Indian Ocean; while from the Philippines and Celebes to the Solomons the
  numbers increase greatly, and many islands have their own peculiar forms.</p>

  <p><i>Gymnoglaux nudipes</i> of the Antilles, remarkable for its unusually bare metatarsi, is
  brown above and white below, with rufous barring throughout; <i>G. lawrencii</i> of Cuba having
  the leg-feathers less extended, and being spotted with white on the more uniform upper surface.
  <i>Speotyto cunicularia</i>, the Burrowing Owl, a comparatively long-legged and short-winged bird
  with incomplete facial discs and unfeathered toes, is umber-brown varied with yellowish and white,
  the lower parts becoming lighter. From the confines of British Columbia it extends through the
  Western and Southern United States, a few of the Antilles, and the greater part of the Neotropical
  Region, several fairly distinct races having been described. Large communities in North America
  occupy the burrows of prairie-dogs, rats, ground-squirrels, or badgers; in South America those of
  the biscacha, the Patagonian hare, and even of armadillos and large lizards; but they are said to
  make their own holes, if necessary. The homes seem usually to be shared by the separate pairs with
  the original owners, and sometimes with intruders such as rattlesnakes; while a nest of grass,
  feathers, and rubbish is made at the further end, where from five to ten eggs may be found,
  surrounded by castings. Mainly diurnal and generally fearless, these birds fly strongly for short
  distances, and procure their food of small mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page410"><span class="smaller">{410}</span></span>chiefly on the ground, where
  they are quite at ease. A croaking sound is made while courting, but the ordinary cry is long and
  shrill; both parents, moreover, fly chattering over an intruder at the breeding colonies, while
  individuals often sit bowing or twisting their heads about on the roofs of houses.</p>

  <p><i>Carine noctua</i>, the Little Owl of British authors, is greyish-brown above with white
  markings, and white with brown streaks below. The facial discs are imperfect; the toes are
  bristly&ndash;or <span class="pagenum" id="page411"><span
  class="smaller">{411}</span></span>feathered in the race from Northern and Central Asia (<i>C.
  plumipes</i> or <i>bactriana</i>). Another race (<i>C. glaux</i>), of a more sandy colour,
  occupies North Africa, whence the species ranges to Denmark, the Baltic and the Urals, and through
  Palestine and Afghanistan to East Siberia and North China. It occurs in England, where liberated
  specimens breed, but possibly diminish in numbers. <i>C. spilogastra</i> is found in Abyssinia,
  <i>C. superciliaris</i> in Madagascar, <i>C. brama</i> in India and Baluchistan. The Little Owl is
  semi-diurnal, and haunts wooded country and orchards; the flight in the day is undulating and slow
  with many flaps; the note is a muffled monosyllabic or disyllabic cry, a noisy bark, a mew, or a
  wail; the food consists of rodents, birds, reptiles, frogs, insects, snails, and worms. From three
  to five eggs are deposited on d&eacute;bris in crevices of rocks or masonry, in buildings, hollow trees,
  or even ant-hills. Of old the European form was the bird of Pallas Athene and the emblem of
  wisdom, but whether from its grave appearance when quiescent, or&ndash;sarcastically&ndash;from
  its buffoon-like contortions and bowings must remain doubtful; we may, however, compare the
  Malagasy name of <i>Scops magicus</i>, "atoroko," which means "I am going to say," and the
  similarly philosophic look that it can put on.</p>

  <p><i>Surnia ulula</i> or <i>funerea</i>, the Hawk-Owl, ranges from Scandinavia and North Russia
  to Kamtschatka or even Alaska, whence a race with a blacker head, and broader, redder bands below,
  stretches through Arctic America, and visits Britain more commonly than the typical form. This is
  dark brown above, freely marked with white, and white below, with distinct but narrow brown bars;
  the facial disks are very imperfect, the toes are feathered to the claws. The exceptionally
  compact and firm plumage, the short, acuminate wings, and the long tail conduce to its Hawk-like
  appearance, heightened still more by the quick flight, the fierce manners, and the shrill
  Kestrel-like cry. From their native pine-forests a few individuals wander southwards towards
  winter; while at home they feed on lemmings and rodents generally, Willow Grouse and other birds,
  and insects. They sit watching for prey on bare branches or stumps in the sunlight, occasionally
  dashing after a Jay or the like; not unfrequently they quarter the ground like a Harrier, and of
  course hunt at night also. From three to eight eggs are deposited on a few chips in hollow stumps,
  in boxes set up by the Lapps, or in a relined nest of some other species; the parents being
  perfectly fearless in their attacks on an intruder.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page412"><span class="smaller">{412}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Nyctea scandiaca</i>, the white Snowy Owl, occasionally exhibiting spots or broken bars of
  black, has ill-developed facial discs and hardly visible tufts, but very thickly feathered feet.
  It inhabits the circumpolar fjelds, tundras, and barren grounds, straying as far as Britain,
  France, Lower Austria, the Indus Valley and the Bermudas in winter; but when rodents abound on the
  fells of Norway and Sweden a greater number remain there to breed. The flight is strong and easy;
  the habits are diurnal; the food consists of lemmings, rats, mice, squirrels, hares, birds large
  or small, fishes, and doubtless insects. It is called Harf&auml;ng (hare-catcher) in Scandinavia. This
  Owl either catches the fishes in one claw as it skims over the water, or crouches on some stone or
  piece of ice till the moment comes to strike; at times, moreover, it will follow sportsmen in the
  field. The cry, seldom heard, is wild and wailing. The large, oval eggs, numbering from three to
  five, or even ten when food is plentiful, are deposited in holes scraped in the soil on ledges of
  rocks or other eminences, sometimes lined with moss and feathers; they appear occasionally to be
  laid in pairs at intervals. The parents, though usually wary, will attack a man at the nest.</p>

  <p>The cosmopolitan genus <i>Scops</i>, found almost everywhere except in the extreme north,
  Australia, Oceania, and the southern portion of South America, contains some fifty so-called
  species which it would be useless to discuss in the present state of our information, though
  certain of them are mentioned below. Rufous, brown, and grey phases undoubtedly occur, but the
  various plumages are still very imperfectly understood. Perhaps two-thirds of the forms occur in
  the Old World, yet only one (<i>S. giu</i>) inhabits the Palaearctic Region west of Japan, though
  there we find <i>S. semitorques</i>. The general coloration is a mixture of grey, brown, chocolate
  or rufous, with a less amount of black, yellowish, and white; some species are finely
  vermiculated, others hardly at all, while several are almost barred below and many are distinctly
  banded on the tail. The facial discs are incomplete, but the head-tufts are well developed; the
  metatarsi and toes are feathered, or bristly, or the latter are occasionally bare. <i>Scops
  giu</i>, the Petit Duc of France, which visits Britain and Holland, extends over Central and
  Southern Europe, Asia Minor, Palestine, Persia, and Turkestan, occurring in North Africa, and
  migrating as far southwards as Abyssinia and Senegal. Sub-species occupy the Ethiopian Region, and
  Asia to Japan and <span class="pagenum" id="page413"><span
  class="smaller">{413}</span></span>Siam; <i>S. brucii</i>, ranging from Transcaspia to India being
  possibly separable. The type species is grey above with the middle of the feathers dark, the back
  being vermiculated with brown and the wings spotted with white; the whitish lower parts are more
  streaky and the toes bare. It feeds by night on mice, small birds, grasshoppers, moths, and
  beetles; and utters a melancholy metallic single note, which rings monotonously through the woods
  it haunts; in the day it hides in thick cypresses and the like. Five or six roundish eggs are
  deposited in holes in trees, rocks, and buildings, or rarely in deserted birds' nests; no bedding
  being added, though the opposite is the case in some Indian species. <i>S. asio</i>, the Mottled
  or American Screech-Owl, reaches with its different races from Alaska and Canada to Guatemala, and
  is said to have a wailing cry, varied by deep guttural trills. <i>S. flammeola</i> occurs from
  Colorado and California to Guatemala; and thence various species carry the range to Brazil. The
  Ethiopian Region generally is tenanted by <i>S. leucotis</i>, the Gold Coast by <i>S.
  icterorhynchus</i>, Anjuan in the Comoros by <i>S. capnodes</i>, Madagascar by <i>S.
  rutilus</i>&ndash;though this is said to be a form of <i>S. magicus</i>, extending from Celebes to
  about New Guinea; the Indian Region and the Moluccas possess a large number of species, among
  which <i>S. gymnopus</i> of India (with half-naked metatarsi like <i>S. nudipes</i> of Veragua)
  may be mentioned.</p>

  <p><i>Bubo ignavus</i>, the Eagle-Owl, which visits Britain, and is the Grand Duc of the French,
  is blackish-brown above, with yellowish-rufous mottlings and interrupted wing- and tail-bars; it
  is yellowish-buff below with blackish streaks and indistinct transverse markings. The facial discs
  are fairly distinct, the head-tufts are long, and the toes thickly feathered. This fierce species,
  one of the largest of the Family, inhabits rugged mountains and forests throughout Europe, Asia
  north of the Himalayas to Japan, and North Africa; it is partly diurnal, and preys chiefly upon
  hares, rabbits, large game birds, and rodents, being said moreover to attack fawns. The flight is
  powerful, though undulating and flapping; the cry is a deep "hoo, hoo," occasionally sounding like
  a laugh or neigh. Two, or rarely three, roundish eggs are deposited in holes scraped in the soil
  on rocky ledges or on banks, in disused birds' nests, in hollow trees, or even between their
  branches or roots; little lining, if any, being added. Nearly allied forms are <i>B.
  turcomanus</i> of South-West Siberia and Turkestan, <span class="pagenum" id="page414"><span
  class="smaller">{414}</span></span><i>B. blakistoni</i> of Japan, and <i>B. dorriesi</i> of East
  Siberia; <i>B. milesi</i> is found at Muscat, <i>B. abyssinicus</i> in Somali-Land, <i>B.
  bengalensis</i>&ndash;which eats reptiles and crabs&ndash;in India, <i>B. nipalensis</i> and <i>B.
  coromandus</i>&ndash;which occasionally lays eggs spotted with lilac and brown&ndash;in the same
  country and Burma, <i>B. orientalis</i> in Malacca and the Great Sunda Islands, <i>B.
  philippensis</i> in the Philippines. <i>B. lacteus</i> covers all the Ethiopian Region, except the
  west, where <i>B. shelleyi</i>, <i>B. lettii</i>, <i>B. leucostictus</i> and <i>B. po&euml;nsis</i>
  occur, the last being also met with in Fernando Po. <i>B. ascalaphus</i> inhabits North Africa and
  Palestine, <i>B. cinerascens</i> North-East and <i>B. maculosus</i> South Africa, <i>B.
  capensis</i> extending from the South to the East. All North America is occupied by <i>B.
  virginianus</i>, barred instead of streaked below; the species or sub-species <i>B. nigrescens</i>
  and <i>B. magellanicus</i> coming respectively from Ecuador and the districts from Peru and Brazil
  to the extreme south. Some forms have more white in the plumage than the British Eagle-Owl, or
  bare toes. All seem destructive to game and often to poultry. <i>B. ignavus</i> and <i>B.
  virginianus</i> have been kept in confinement in England, and the former has propagated
  freely.</p>

  <p><i>Scotopelia peli</i>, of West Africa and the Zambesi Region, has rufous upper parts with
  black bars, and fawn-coloured lower surface with the bars less regular; it feeds on reptiles and
  fish as well as small animals. This fine large bird has two congeners, <i>S. ussheri</i> of Fantee
  and <i>S. bouvieri</i> of the Gaboon. <i>Ketupa ceylonensis</i>, a still bigger species, ranging
  from India and Ceylon to Hong-Kong, is buffish-brown above, with the middle of the feathers
  blackish, and fulvous below with dark streaks and closely set brown bands, the throat being white.
  <i>K. flavipes</i>, of the Himalayas and China, and the smaller <i>K. javanensis</i> of the Malay
  Peninsula, Siam, and the Great Sunda Islands, have no bands below; but all have fine head-tufts
  and naked legs. They frequent coasts or wooded streams, where they can easily procure their main
  diet of fish, crabs, and insects; they remain under cover in the day, and the last-named at least
  utters a soft, low whistle. The two roundish eggs, which have the surface pitted like those of the
  Eagle-Owl, are often laid on ledges or in recesses of rocks, in hollow trees, or at the junction
  of the larger branches, but more commonly a deserted nest is relined for the purpose.</p>

  <p>Of fossil forms referred to the Family, <i>Necrobyas harpax</i> and <i>N. rossignoli</i> are
  described from the Eocene of France, together <span class="pagenum" id="page415"><span
  class="smaller">{415}</span></span>with <i>Otus</i> (i.e. <i>Asio</i>) and <i>Bubo</i>; the latter
  genus and <i>Strix</i> occur in the Lower Miocene of the same country, <i>Strix</i> also in the
  Malta caverns and in the Mare aux Songes in Mauritius, <i>Nyctea</i> at Torquay and in France,
  <i>Bubo</i> in Wyoming, <i>Badiostes</i> in Patagonia.</p>

  <p>The Sub-Order <span class="sc">Caprimulgi</span> consists of the Nightjar or Goat-sucker group,
  with the Families <i>Caprimulgidae</i>, <i>Podargidae</i>, and <i>Steatornithidae</i>, of which
  the latter contains only the remarkable Gu&aacute;charo. The <i>Caprimulgidae</i> may be divided into the
  Sub-families (1) <i>Caprimulginae</i> and (2) <i>Nyctibiinae</i>. Authorities disagree as to the
  exact relationship of these birds to their allies, here classified as Coraciiformes; but that all
  are allies is certain, while both in appearance and habits Nightjars are decidedly Owl-like.</p>

  <p>Apart from the Steatornithidae, the skull is flattened, the eyes are large, the beak is short
  and extremely broad, being hooked and toothed in the Nyctibiinae and occasionally decurved in the
  Caprimulginae and Podargidae; the gape is enormously wide, and is in many cases provided with
  stiff bristles, which in <i>Aegotheles</i> have long lateral filaments. An appearance of great
  size is given to the head by the loose plumage. The feet are fairly strong, with the digits
  somewhat united basally; the anteriorly scutellated metatarsi vary from comparatively long and
  bare in <i>Nyctidromus</i> and the Podargidae to very short and feathered in <i>Nyctibius</i>. The
  outer toe of the Caprimulginae has only four joints, and the mid-toe has a pectinated claw, while
  in the Podargidae and some Caprimulginae the hallux is partially reversible. The pointed wing has
  ten primaries, sometimes much elongated (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page418">418</a></span>),
  and eleven or twelve secondaries; the tail may be square, rounded, graduated, or forked, and has
  ten rectrices, occasionally lengthened or even racquet-tipped (<i>loc. cit.</i>). The furcula is
  <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the tongue short; the slit-like nostrils are basal and
  overhung by a membrane and feathers in <i>Podargus</i> and <i>Batrachostomus</i>, whereas they are
  open and near the tip of the bill in <i>Aegotheles</i>, but soft, tubular, and often elongated in
  the Caprimulginae. The syrinx is bronchial, sometimes tending to tracheo-bronchial; the aftershaft
  is rudimentary; the adults have down only on the unfeathered tracts, while the nestlings have a
  thick covering of it, which is generally buff or grey, but white in <i>Podargus</i> and
  <i>Batrachostomus</i>.</p>

  <p>The length varies from about twenty inches in <i>Nyctibius</i> and <i>Podargus</i> to seven or
  eight in <i>Caprimulgus parvulus</i> and <span class="pagenum" id="page416"><span
  class="smaller">{416}</span></span><i>Phalaenoptilus nuttalli</i>. The characteristically soft
  plumage shews an intricate mixture of brown, grey, fawn, black, and white, and is ordinarily
  barred and minutely freckled, but frequently patched or spotted with white; it is, however,
  impossible in a limited space to describe the species in detail, though it may be noticed that
  several have reddish nuchal collars; and some exhibit rufous and grey phases&ndash;unless, as may
  be the case, the rufous forms are females&ndash;while others from arid districts have a protective
  coloration of a more or less sandy hue. In the Podargidae large powder-down patches occur
  laterally on the rump, in the Nyctibiinae on the breast and sides. The sexes are often alike, the
  young either resembling the female, or assuming the full plumage at once. <i>Lyncornis</i>,
  <i>Otophanes</i>, and <i>Batrachostomus</i> have head-tufts like those of some Owls, the
  constituent feathers in the last genus being bristle-pointed.</p>

  <p>Nightjars are found in most parts of the world, while the northern species habitually move
  southwards for the winter, <i>Podager</i> and <i>Chordiles</i>, at least, flocking in August and
  September. The most typical forms are distinctly crepuscular, and pass the day&ndash;as our
  British bird does&ndash;quiescent on the soil, or upon some post or fence, often concealing
  themselves below shrubs or herbage, or in hollow stumps. At such times they will almost permit
  themselves to be trodden upon before rising from the ground, and sit with their eyes closed; on
  branches the body is ordinarily placed lengthwise, but on thin palings or wire this is of course
  impossible. <i>Nyctidromus</i> exhibits more terrestrial habits, and walks instead of shuffling;
  the American Bull-bat (<i>Chordiles virginianus</i>) hawks in the full glare of the sun. The more
  diurnal species frequently rise to a considerable height in the air, sailing backwards and
  forwards with an easy, flapping motion, descending with undulating swoops, or remaining
  momentarily poised aloft, and then darting suddenly upon their prey; the flight of their nocturnal
  allies is weaker and more lowly, being jerky, twisting, and erratic. Some forms, if not all, when
  inspecting an intruder turn the head almost completely round. The vibrating sound often
  accompanying the passage through the air may be produced by the wings coming into contact, as is
  the clapping noise occasionally heard; but the cause is not certainly ascertained, nor is that of
  the far-resounding churr uttered by the male of the Common Nightjar while stationary. The birds
  are, however, often quiet on the <span class="pagenum" id="page417"><span
  class="smaller">{417}</span></span>wing, and steal upon the listener noiselessly with the mouth
  widely opened. The voice is generally hollow, but is described in various cases as a "croak," a
  "loud shrill cry," a "sad whistle," a "jarring note," or a "moan"; while the American
  Whip-poor-Will (<i>Antrostomus vociferus</i>), Chuck-Will's-widow (<i>A. carolinensis</i>), and
  Poor-Will (<i>Phalaenoptilus</i>), as well as the Tasmanian More-pork (<i>Podargus cuvieri</i>),
  are so called from the sounds they rapidly utter. The second of these is said to be silent when
  breeding, contrary to the habit of our Nightjar. The food consists as a rule of insects, and
  especially beetles, captured in the air; but the Podargidae are asserted to pick Phasmidae and
  Cicadidae off the trees, and even to eat fruit&ndash;as <i>Steatornis</i> does&ndash;or mice.<a
  id="NtA_236" href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Most Nightjars make no nest, but lay one or two white, yellowish, or pinkish eggs, beautifully
  marbled or scrawled with black, gray, brown, or violet, on the ground in open spots, frequently
  shaded by trees, ferns, or gorse. More rarely lichen-covered rocks or flat house-tops are chosen.
  <i>Phalaenoptilus</i> has white eggs, like those of the Podargidae, among which <i>Podargus</i>
  makes a flat, loose structure of twigs and grass upon some branch to contain its complement of
  three, and <i>Batrachostomus</i> deposits one on a peculiar pad of brown or greyish down, which is
  fixed to a bough and is at times based on a little bark, lichen, moss, or leaf-refuse.<a
  id="NtA_237" href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> <i>Aegotheles</i> lays from three to five in
  hollow trees, the parent hissing if caught upon them. Eggs of <i>Ae. wallacii</i> are stated to
  shew pale streaks. <i>Nyctibius</i> appears to breed in hollows of branches or stumps, and not on
  the ground.<a id="NtA_238" href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> Nightjars sit very closely, and are
  said to remove the contents of the nest if disturbed; the young, though hatched helpless, quickly
  learn to escape from danger; while the parents occasionally feign lameness to divert attention
  from them. The males sometimes incubate.</p>

  <p>The superstitious of all classes are inclined to view these birds with dread, a fact due to
  their nocturnal habits and Owl-like aspect, coupled with their strange utterances and sudden
  apparitions. The Indians of Central and South America think that they portend serious evil, but
  refuse to kill them; while in England gamekeepers and others are only too ready to shoot them
  under the unfair designation of "Night-hawk."</p>

  <p>Fam. VIII. <b>Caprimulgidae.</b>&ndash;Of this group some eighty species <span class="pagenum"
  id="page418"><span class="smaller">{418}</span></span>occupy nearly the whole globe, except the
  coldest parts, the Eastern Pacific Islands and New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Caprimulginae.</i>&ndash;<i>Caprimulgus europaeus</i>, the Nightjar, Goatsucker,
  or Fern-Owl, visits Britain for the summer, and extends from Europe and North Africa to South
  Mongolia in Asia, reaching North-West India and South Africa in winter. <i>C. ruficollis</i> of
  South-West Europe and the neighbouring portions of Africa has once occurred in England, as has
  <i>C. aegyptius</i> of North-East Africa and West Asia. The genera <i>Heleothreptus</i> of Brazil
  and Argentina, and <i>Macrodipteryx</i> of Tropical Africa, contain respectively one and two
  members, remarkable for the extraordinary elongation of the remiges in the male. <i>H.
  anomalus</i> has the first six primaries curved inwards, the seventh, eighth, and ninth
  prolonged&ndash;especially the eighth; <i>M. vexillarius</i>, the Pennant-winged Nightjar, has the
  same three feathers produced, but the ninth in particular; <i>M. macrodipterus</i> has the ninth
  alone extended, with long bare shaft and racquet-like tip: and this is at times erected when the
  bird is sitting on the ground. <i>Scotornis climacurus</i> of the north of Tropical Africa, the
  four species of <i>Hydropsalis</i>, inhabiting South America southwards to Argentina, and the
  three of <i>Macropsalis</i>, ranging from Panama to Bolivia and South-East Brazil, have enormously
  elongated rectrices, the median pair being highly developed in the first-named, the whole number
  in the second, and the lateral pair in the last. These long feathers seem to impede the flight but
  little, though <i>Hydropsalis</i> constantly opens and shuts its tail in the air.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Nyctibiinae.</i>&ndash;Six species of <i>Nyctibius</i> occur in Tropical
  America, including Jamaica, and utter wailing cries.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page419"><span class="smaller">{419}</span></span></div>

  <p>Fam. IX. <b>Podargidae.</b>&ndash;This group includes some five and twenty members of the
  genera <i>Podargus</i>, <i>Batrachostomus</i><a id="NtA_239" href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a>
  (Frog-mouth), and <i>Aegotheles</i>. The first and last occupy Papuasia, Tasmania, and Australia,
  the second ranges from the Himalayas to Ceylon, the Philippines, and Malay Islands.</p>

  <p>Fam. X. <b>Steatornithidae.</b>&ndash;This contains only the curious Gu&aacute;charo, or Oil-bird
  (<i>Steatornis caripensis</i>) discovered in 1799 by Humboldt and Bonpland at Carip&eacute; in Venezuela,
  but now known to breed also in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, as well as in Guiana and Trinidad.
  Somewhat intermediate between the Owls and the Nightjars, this species is about the size of a
  Crow, with a similar hard beak, hooked and deeply notched, while it has twelve long stiff bristles
  on each side of the gape. The tibiae and metatarsi are covered with smooth, flesh-coloured skin,
  the toes being deeply cleft, and not basally united. The tongue is thin and triangular, the
  nostrils have a horny covering, the after-shaft is fairly large, while the rest of the structure
  is mainly Caprimulgine. The acuminate and not particularly soft feathers are chocolate and grey,
  with darker barring above, and shew white spots, often surrounded by black, in various parts. This
  bird inhabits sea-side or mountain-caverns, only issuing forth at dusk to traverse considerable
  distances in search of its food, which consists mainly, if not wholly, of fruits. The flight is
  noiseless, and occasionally high in the air. Visitors to the breeding caves are suddenly
  surrounded by a circling crowd of Oil-birds uttering loud croaking or rasping cries, the effect
  being enhanced by the rush of multitudinous wings. A more plaintive note is uttered by individuals
  at rest. The numerous nests, each containing from two to four white or dirt-begrimed eggs, are
  flat circular masses of a clay-like substance, placed on ledges or in holes; while the nestlings
  are considered a table delicacy, though said to be scented like cockroaches. The natives
  systematically kill large numbers at certain seasons by knocking them down with poles when scared
  by torchlight, and melt out the abundant fat to procure the oil, which gives the bird its name.
  This oil is used for illumination or cooking, and keeps admirably.</p>

  <p>The Sub-Order <span class="sc">Cypseli</span> consists of the Families <i>Cypselidae</i> or
  Swifts, and <i>Trochilidae</i> or Humming-birds,<a id="NtA_240"
  href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> which were first <span class="pagenum" id="page420"><span
  class="smaller">{420}</span></span>grouped together by Nitzsch as <i>Macrochires</i> (long-handed
  forms) from the length of their manual bones, though really the parts of the wing nearer the body
  are proportionally most elongated.</p>

  <p>Swifts certainly differ from Humming-birds in the broad, flat skull, the short curved bill, and
  the extremely wide gape, besides their comparatively sombre coloration; but these facts cannot be
  allowed to militate against an alliance so strongly confirmed by many points of structure, while
  nothing but the pardonable ignorance of former times caused the Family to be united with their
  Passerine analogues, the Swallows. The <i>Cypselidae</i> agree with the <i>Trochilidae</i> in the
  number and colour of their eggs, and the extraordinarily deep keel of the sternum, which, with the
  long wings, gives so great a power of flight.</p>

  <p>Fam. XI. <b>Cypselidae.</b>&ndash;Of this group three Sub-families may be recognised, (1)
  <i>Macropteryginae</i>, (2) <i>Chaeturinae</i>, and (3) <i>Cypselinae</i>.</p>

  <p>The short but robust metatarsi are scutellated anteriorly, the scales being nearly obsolete in
  the Chaeturinae; fairly powerful claws terminate the free toes, which are all directed forwards in
  the Cypselinae, though the hallux is somewhat laterally inclined in <i>Panyptila</i>, and is said
  to be occasionally versatile in the other Sub-families. The middle and outer digits in the
  Cypselinae have the further peculiarity of possessing only three joints, while the metatarsi or
  even the toes are feathered. The ten primaries, and especially the exterior, are extremely long,
  with thick narrow outer webs; the short secondaries vary from six to eight. The square or forked
  tail has ten rectrices&ndash;not uncommonly rigid and pointed&ndash;as against twelve in Swallows.
  The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the tongue sagittate; the syrinx
  tracheo-bronchial (the muscles not being inserted on the bronchial rings); the aftershaft is large
  or small; the adults have a little blackish down on the unfeathered spaces; the nestlings are
  blind and naked.</p>

  <p>The coloration is usually greenish-black or mouse-brown, occasionally with a white chin,
  breast, or rump; a rufous collar or chestnut ear-coverts occur in <i>Macropteryx</i> and
  <i>Cypselo&iuml;des</i>, where alone the males differ from the females, and the young from both. The
  Family ranges over the whole world, with the exception of the extreme north and south, New Zealand
  and some other islands; the six genera containing about eighty species varying in size from about
  four to fourteen inches.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page421"><span class="smaller">{421}</span></span></div>

  <p>Swifts are essentially a&euml;rial, seldom alighting upon the ground, or perching except at night,<a
  id="NtA_241" href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> though they will cling to the entrance of their
  breeding quarters for a few seconds before entering. From a smooth flat surface they can hardly
  rise, but in the air they are perfectly at home, whether wheeling and circling at great altitudes,
  chasing each other aloft, consummating their love affairs, or sweeping over the earth's surface in
  pursuit of insects attracted by the damp. The exceptionally rapid flight is strong and practically
  unlimited in duration, two or three quick movements of the wings being repeatedly succeeded by a
  gliding motion. Though not gregarious in the ordinary sense, they habitually breed in company, and
  <i>Collocalia</i> nests in vast colonies; a solitary bird, moreover, is comparatively seldom seen,
  and both before and during incubation our Common Swift flies in screaming flocks around the chosen
  sites. This species will pass and re-pass close to a pedestrian's head with noisy and apparently
  vicious rush, even when far from the nest; yet it is not really the intruder but insects that are
  the attraction, the food being entirely of that nature, and invariably captured in the air, while
  the beak may be seen filled to repletion when nestlings require to be supported. The voice is a
  shrill scream, constantly repeated. The districts frequented are of every description, <i>Cypselus
  andicola</i> and <i>C. horus</i> being particularly alpine; the nest varies to a considerable
  extent, though a glutinous substance secreted by the highly developed salivary glands is a
  constant, or frequently almost the sole, material. The situation may be a hole under thatch,
  slates or tiles; a crevice in a building, cliff, or tree; the perpendicular wall of a cave; the
  upper side of a branch, palm-leaf, or broad stalk; the lower surface of a rock, and so forth. The
  shape of the structure is tubular in <i>Panyptila</i>, where it is composed of seeds of plants;
  but generally it is saucer-like, the materials being straw, feathers, twigs, moss, or cottony
  vegetable matter, the first two of which have been stated to be caught floating in the air. The
  American Chimney-Swift plucks off branchlets as it flies. <i>Cypselus affinis</i> and the species
  of <i>Collocalia</i> commonly join their nests together in masses; Palm Swifts do so more rarely;
  <i>Cypselus caffer</i> even utilizes those of other birds. The dull white eggs are oval and almost
  uniform at each end; <span class="pagenum" id="page422"><span
  class="smaller">{422}</span></span>two or four being the usual complement, though three are
  exceptionally found, and <i>Macropteryx</i> lays only one.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Macropteryginae.</i>&ndash;The Tree-Swifts, as they are called, have very soft
  plumage, a long, deeply-forked tail, a patch of downy feathers on the flanks, and elongated
  plumage on the top or sides of the head. They range from India and Ceylon through the Burmese and
  Malay countries, and the islands thence to the Solomon Group. <i>Macropteryx coronata</i> of
  India, Ceylon, Burma, and Siam has bluish ash-coloured upper parts, glossed with metallic green,
  especially on the crested head, wings, and tail; the under surface is greyish and white, the chin
  and ear-coverts are rufous. The female lacks the chestnut. The nest is a half saucer of bits of
  bark and feathers, gummed by saliva to a branch some twenty feet from the ground, trees being
  usually selected in rough jungle on low hills. It contains one egg, and is so small that the
  sitting bird quite conceals it. Other species are <i>M. longipennis</i>, <i>M. wallacii</i>, <i>M.
  comata</i>, and the larger and most eastern <i>M. mystacea</i>.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Chaeturinae.</i>&ndash;Of the three genera, <i>Chaetura</i>, <i>Cypselo&iuml;des</i>,
  and <i>Collocalia</i>, the first occurs from Central Asia and India to Japan, New Guinea and
  Australia; in Tropical Africa; and in the Nearctic and Neotropical Regions, except the extreme
  north and south. All the species, numbering about fifty, have rigid tail-feathers with more or
  less projecting spiny shafts, save in <i>Collocalia</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Chaetura caudacuta</i>, which has strayed to Britain and New Zealand, ranges from Mongolia
  and Japan to China and the Eastern Himalayas, wintering southwards to Australia and Tasmania. It
  is dusky-brown with greenish-black head, wings, and tail, white forehead and breast. The nest,
  placed on cliffs or in hollow trees, is probably similar to that of the next species, several
  pairs nidificating together. <i>C. pelagica</i>, the "Chimney Swallow" of the United States,
  chiefly found in the east, but extending to the Fur Countries and the Great Plains, and in winter
  at least to Mexico and Yucatan, is dark grey, with lighter lower surface, blackish head and wings.
  It has almost ceased to breed in trees, but fastens its semicircular nest of small twigs, glued
  together with salivary secretion, to the inside of chimneys, laying from four to six white eggs.
  <i>C. zonaris</i>, extending from the West Indies and Mexico to Argentina, is uniform
  blackish-brown with white collar and breast; <i>C. novae guineae</i> of Papua is glossy
  greenish-blue above, and grey below, with an <span class="pagenum" id="page423"><span
  class="smaller">{423}</span></span>exceptionally short tail; <i>C. ussheri</i> of the Gold Coast
  is dark brown, varied with a good deal of white; <i>C. cassini</i> of the Congo and Gaboon, and
  <i>C. boehmi</i> of East Equatorial Africa, are glossy black with less white. <i>C. acuta</i> of
  the West Indies, <i>C. grandidieri</i> of Madagascar, and other forms, complete the genus.</p>

  <p>In <i>Cypselo&iuml;des</i> the shafts of the rectrices scarcely project perceptibly; while the tail
  is emarginate in <i>C. niger</i> of western North America, the Antilles, and Guiana. The
  coloration is plain black or brown, with a reddish collar round the neck in the males of <i>C.
  rutilus</i> and <i>C. brunneitorques</i>. The genus ranges to Peru and Brazil. The nest, placed in
  holes in houses and so forth, is made of straw, leaves, and rubbish; the eggs are four or
  five.</p>

  <p><i>Collocalia</i> is an especially interesting section of the Family, on account of the nests
  furnishing the birds'-nest soup of the Chinese. Being formed of the dried secretions of the
  salivary glands,<a id="NtA_242" href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> these are almost entirely
  glutinous, and when newly built are termed white or "first quality." The thirteen diminutive
  species are black or brown above, occasionally with a blue gloss, and white on the rump or tail;
  the under parts being whitish or grey. They are not migratory, but extend over most of the Indian
  and Australian regions, except the northernmost portions, being found as far south as North
  Australia. One form reaches the Mascarene Islands. Huge numbers breed in company in dark caves,
  sticking their nests close together upon the rocky walls, or even joining them in masses; the
  materials may include moss, straw, lichen, and so forth, but inspissated saliva is the chief, and
  often the only, constituent, especially in <i>C. fuciphaga</i>. Brown nests are those discoloured
  by use, or spoilt by an admixture of foreign substances, and are considered hardly worth
  collecting. Two eggs are the usual complement. The caverns are entered from boats below, or by
  ladders from above, other ladders or poles notched for the feet being fixed in the rocky flooring
  of the interior. These are ascended by natives armed with long-pronged forks, who obtain hundreds
  of nests at one gathering. Bats occupy the caves by day, the birds by night or when incubating;
  while at any time the noise of the escaping denizens is almost deafening. The breeding sites are a
  very lucrative property. The especially valuable <i>C. fuciphaga</i>, which obtained its specific
  name from the erroneous idea that it built <span class="pagenum" id="page424"><span
  class="smaller">{424}</span></span>with partly digested sea-weed, extends (if we include several
  more or less distinct races) from the Duke of York Island and the Ladrones in the east to the
  hills of India, Ceylon, and the Mascarene Group in the west, a small species of slightly more
  eastern range with whitish band on the rump being known as <i>C. francica</i>.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Cypselinae.</i>&ndash;This contains only the genera <i>Panyptila</i> and
  <i>Cypselus</i>, granted that the latter is not further divided. The former has feathered toes, a
  deeply forked tail with pointed outer feathers, and soft, silky black plumage, varied with white.
  The very remarkable architecture of <i>P. sancti hieronymi</i> of Guatemala is described as
  follows by Mr. Salvin:<a id="NtA_243" href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a> "The nest of this
  species is composed entirely of the seeds of a plant, secured together and hung from the under
  surface of an overhanging rock by the saliva of the bird. The whole structure measures 2 feet 2
  inches in length, and is about 6 inches in diameter. The entrance is at the [lower] end, and the
  hollow for the eggs at the top." The cavity in the above case was in the shape of a walking-stick,
  with its knob bent laterally at the top, while a false entrance shewed at one side. <i>P.
  cayennensis</i>, ranging from Nicaragua to Brazil, makes a similar nest on trees.</p>

  <p>The coloration of the twenty or more species of <i>Cypselus</i> is sooty-black or mouse-brown,
  frequently exhibiting a metallic gloss, while the collar, rump, abdomen, or edges of the feathers
  may be white. A forked tail is not uncommon, and the strong toes are feathered in <i>C.
  melanoleucus</i> and <i>C. squamatus</i>. <i>C. apus</i>, the Common Swift or Deviling of Britain,
  is found through Europe, North Africa, and Asia southward to the Himalayas, migrating to South
  Africa, Madagascar, and Southern Asia. A paler race (<i>C. pallidus</i> or <i>murinus</i>) extends
  from the Atlantic Islands and the Mediterranean basin to Bogos Land and Sind. The habits are
  well-known; but it may be observed that in flying the wings take the form of a bent bow, and that
  on the Continent it builds in hollow trees instead of in holes under eaves, in walls or cliffs.
  Few individuals remain with us after early September. <i>C. unicolor</i> is peculiar to Madeira,
  the Canaries, and the Cape Verd Islands; <i>C. affinis</i> reaches from Africa and Palestine to
  India; <i>C. melba</i>, the "Alpine Swift," inhabits the same Asiatic countries, extending
  westward to South Europe and North Africa, and wandering north to Britain and Heligoland.</p>

  <p>Fam. XII. The <b>Trochilidae</b>, or Humming-birds, so called from the sound often made by the
  vibrating wings, are New World forms noted for their grace and beauty. The English name dates back
  to at least 1632, while one species from Hispaniola is mentioned as "paxaro mosquito" by Oviedo in
  his <i>Hystoria general de las Indias</i>, as early as 1525. This appellation still remains as the
  French "Oiseau-mouche," that of <i>Trochilus</i> having been borrowed from Pliny by Barr&egrave;re, who
  believed Humming-birds to be allied to the Wren, the <i>Trochilus</i> in part of the Latin author.

  his copyists originated a chain of errors. From native sources we have the names Guainumbi,
  Ourissia, and Colibri, from the Spanish "Picaflor" and Tominejo (atom); from Mexico "Chupa-rosa"
  and "Chupa-myrta" (Rose-sucker and Myrtle-sucker); from the West Indies "Murmures" and
  "Bourdons."<a id="NtA_245" href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The sternum is enormously developed both in length and depth of keel, thus furnishing a wide
  base for the attachment of the particularly strong wing-muscles, which support the untiring
  flight. Herein Humming-birds resemble Swifts, but the head is much more compressed, and the bill
  is slender and elongated, except in nestlings; they are in fact the longest billed members of the
  Class <i>Aves</i> in proportion to their size, which in this Family reaches the minimum. Both
  mandibles may be serrated, and the maxilla is hooked in <i>Androdon</i> and <i>Rhamphodon</i>; but
  for details of the variable beak, remiges and rectrices, reference must be made to the species
  described below. The metatarsus, feathered in such genera as <i>Eriocnemis</i> and
  <i>Loddigesia</i>, is short; the toes being usually diminutive, but sometimes stronger, and the
  claws either small and rounded, or elongated, curved, and sharp. The ten primaries, of which the
  outermost is the longest, except in <i>Aithurus</i>&ndash;where it is shorter than the
  next&ndash;are frequently rigid; in the male "Sabre-wings" (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page435">435</a></span>) the shafts of two or three are extraordinarily dilated and curved;
  while the tenth is occasionally <span class="pagenum" id="page427"><span
  class="smaller">{427}</span></span>filiform at the tip or narrowed throughout. The secondaries are
  only six, or rarely seven. The tail of ten feathers may be long or short, but differs profoundly
  in shape, texture, and colour; being for example cuneate in <i>Pha&euml;thornis</i> and
  <i>Sphenoproctus</i>, nearly square in <i>Urosticte</i> and <i>Hylocharis</i>, rounded in
  <i>Adelomyia</i> and <i>Polytmus</i>, deeply forked in <i>Sappho</i>, <i>Lesbia</i>, and the four
  genera next named, of which <i>Prymnacantha</i> has the outer pair of rectrices very narrow and
  pointed, <i>Loddigesia</i>, <i>Spathura</i>, and <i>Discura</i> spatulate.</p>

  <p>The very characteristic tongue consists of a double tube, tapering and separating into two
  externally lacerated sheaths at the tip, which contain the extensile portion. The "horns" of the
  hyoid apparatus are greatly elongated, and pass round and over the back of the head, meeting near
  the top, and thence stretching in an ample groove to terminate in front of the eyes. This
  arrangement, analogous to that found in Woodpeckers, allows the tongue to be suddenly protruded to
  a considerable distance, and withdrawn again in an instant. The furcula is <span class="sans
  fwb">U</span>-shaped; the syrinx has one or two pairs of tracheo-bronchial muscles; the aftershaft
  is very small; a crop is present; while down is absent from both nestlings and adults.</p>

  <p>Except in the "Hermits" (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page435">435</a></span>), the brilliant
  coloration almost defies description, the most exquisite metallic<a id="NtA_246"
  href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> or jewel-like hues glorifying a background of green, blue, or
  brown; while crests, ear-tufts, neck-frills, and pendent beards ending in points or forks, add to
  the effect. Only among the Passerine Sun-birds (Nectariniidae) of the Indian and Ethiopian Regions
  can a fitting parallel be found; but these, though often erroneously termed Humming-birds, have no
  connexion with our New World group. <i>Eulampis</i> and <i>Pterophanes</i> are exceptional in not
  having dusky remiges. The females are usually sombre in comparison, and lack the ornaments of
  their consorts, which are said to be occasionally smaller. The statement that young males have no
  distinctive plumage seems incorrect.</p>

  <p>These gems of Ornithology extend from the north to the extreme south of America, the habits
  differing slightly with the climate; <i>Selasphorus rufus</i> of the Western United States reaches
  Mt. St. Elias in Alaska, <i>Trochilus colubris</i> occurs in the east up to lat. 57&deg; N.,
  <i>Eustephanus galeritus</i> frequents Tierra del Fuego <span class="pagenum" id="page428"><span
  class="smaller">{428}</span></span>even in snowy weather, while <i>Oreotrochilus chimborazo</i>
  and <i>O. pichincha</i> brave the storms of the volcanic regions of the Andes of Ecuador, close to
  the perpetual snow at a height of sixteen thousand feet. The forms found in the furthest north and
  south are few, and draw towards the equator at the cold time of year; while the successional
  flowering of insect-attracting plants, and the seasonal alteration of the snow-line, cause
  latitudinal or altitudinal movements of the same nature. Only eighteen species are recognised as
  occurring north of Mexico by New World ornithologists, but many more inhabit Central America,
  which are either peculiar to that region and even its elevated tablelands, or range into South
  America; none, however, being migrants in the strict sense of the word. The headquarters of the
  Family lie in Colombia and Guiana, though Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil claim many, and
  some of the finest, forms: on the other hand, the dry Peruvian plains and the Argentine Pampas
  lack sufficient insect-food to be favourite residences. With regard to the West Indies the numbers
  increase from the Bahamas to Trinidad, each island often having its own species; <i>Eustephanus
  galeritus</i>, <i>E. fernandensis</i> and <i>E. leyboldi</i> occupy the Juan Fernandez group, and
  the first-named Chili and the Straits of Magellan also. Humming-birds may be roughly divided as
  alpine, sub-alpine, and lowland, while it may be noticed that comparatively few inhabit the great
  forest-clad delta of the Amazon, the congenial centre of so much bird-life.</p>

  <p>The Trochilidae live almost entirely in the air, and fly powerfully, though seldom to great
  distances; they will flit from flower to flower for hours, darting off to each new blossom with
  arrow-like speed, and remaining suspended before it, with the body vertical and the wings in a
  state of tremulous motion, while probing the inmost recesses. This is commonly accompanied by a
  vibratory movement of the tail, which in some cases opens and shuts like a fan. The humming sound,
  produced at each new departure or change of course, and audible for several yards, is due to a
  pulsation of the wings, so rapid that little can be seen of the bird but an indistinct misty
  outline. Messrs. A. and E. Newton give the following charming account of <i>Eulampis
  holosericeus</i><a id="NtA_247" href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a>:&ndash;"One is admiring the
  clustering stars of a Scarlet <i>Cordia</i>, the snowy cornucopias of a <i>Portlandia</i>, or some
  other <span class="pagenum" id="page429"><span class="smaller">{429}</span></span>brilliant and
  beautiful flower, when between the blossom and one's eye suddenly appears a small dark object,
  suspended as it were between four short black threads meeting each other in a cross. For an
  instant it shows in front of the flower; an instant more, it steadies itself, and one perceives
  the space between each pair of threads occupied by a grey film; again another instant, and
  emitting a momentary flash of emerald and sapphire light it is vanishing, lessening in the
  distance, as it shoots away, to a speck that the eye cannot take note of,-&ndash;and all this so
  rapidly that the word on one's lips is still unspoken, scarcely the thought in one's mind changed.
  It was a bold man or an ignorant one who first ventured to depict Humming-birds flying; but it
  cannot be denied that representations of them in that attitude are often of special use to the
  ornithologist. The peculiar action of this, and probably many or all other species of the Family,
  is such, that at times, in flying, it makes the wings almost meet both in front and behind at each
  vibration. Thus, when a bird chances to enter a room, it will generally go buzzing along the
  cornice; standing beneath where it is, one will find that the axis of the body is vertical, and
  each wing is describing a nearly perfect semicircle. As might be expected, the pectoral muscles
  are very large, indeed the sternum of this bird is a good deal bigger than that of the common
  Chimney Swallow (<i>Hirundo rustica</i>, L.). But the extraordinary rapidity with which the
  vibrations are effected seems to be chiefly caused by these powerful muscles acting on the very
  short wing-bones, which are not half the length of the same parts in the Swallow; and accordingly,
  great as this alar action is, and in spite of the contrary opinion entertained by Mr. Gosse
  (<i>Nat. Sojourn in Jamaica</i>, 240), it is yet sometimes wanting in power, owing, doubtless, to
  the disadvantageous leverage thus obtained; and the old authors must be credited who speak of
  cobwebs catching Humming-birds."</p>

  <p>Darwin<a id="NtA_248" href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> writes of <i>Patagona gigas</i>:
  "Like others of the genus, it moves from place to place, with a rapidity which may be compared to
  that of <i>Syrphus</i> among diptera and <i>Sphinx</i> [especially the Humming-bird Sphinx
  (<i>Macroglossa stellatarum</i>)] among moths, but whilst hovering over a flower, it flaps its
  wings with a very slow and powerful movement, totally different from that vibratory one, common to
  most of the species, which produces the humming noise." This slower movement has been observed
  also in <i>Pterophanes temmincki</i>, and no doubt in other large forms, of which the aerial
  course is perhaps more zigzag and jerky than elsewhere. Certain species habitually sit with puffed
  out plumage and somewhat elevated bills; others soar, or skim the surface of water like Bats; the
  tail-feathers, moreover, are often moved sideways or twisted during flight, especially when they
  are elongated or spatulate; and <i>Loddigesia</i> constantly extends them perpendicularly to the
  body, if not further forward, though the racquet-tips may at other times be almost in contact.</p>

  <p>The food consists almost entirely of insects, while the alimentary canal shews but little trace
  of honey, which the birds nevertheless seem to enjoy, when swallowed with the creatures which it
  allures; and as these appear on the lips of flowers chiefly after wet, or in the morning and
  evening, their feathered foes are naturally then most active. Cacti, alstroemeriae, orchids, and
  composites seem particularly attractive, and tubular blossoms to the long-billed species
  especially. Those with shorter beaks, being unable to penetrate the deepest tubes, are said to
  pierce the hinder portions, while it is asserted that those with extremely curved mandibles even
  make use of a twofold process, first inserting the tips, and then raising themselves slightly so
  as to penetrate the recesses. <i>Rhamphodon</i>, <i>Pha&euml;thornis</i>, <i>Eutoxeres</i>, and
  <i>Chlorostilbon</i> examine the crevices of trees and walls for spiders, which they habitually
  eat; while the "Hermits," balanced in the air, pass the bill carefully though quickly over the
  lower surface of leaves in search of insect-diet. <i>Oreotrochilus pichincha</i> has been observed
  clinging to rocks and feeding upon the ground; <i>Aithurus</i>, <i>Petasophora</i>,
  <i>Pygmornis</i>, <i>Lampornis</i>, <i>Patagona</i> and other species, take up posts on dead
  branches or twigs, thence darting upon their prey in Fly-catcher-like style. Gould once managed to
  reach the shores of England with two examples, kept alive on sweetened water and yolk of egg.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page431"><span class="smaller">{431}</span></span></div>

  <p>The males are extraordinarily pugnacious, and one will furiously set upon another who
  interferes in the least with his comfort, the pair circling around with reiterated, high-pitched
  notes, attacking and withdrawing in turn, almost heedless of a fall or collision; finally, beak
  grasps beak, and the struggle grows more intense, until the defeated combatant retreats to some
  friendly tree, only to renew the fight with vigour unimpaired should his defiant note exasperate
  his rival beyond control. Or again, should a prowling hawk, an inoffensive heron or thrush, or
  even a human being, pass perilously near a nest, the cock will make a determined onslaught, often
  with complete success; the hen following his example, if she feels called upon to protect her
  charge. These tiny creatures seem absolutely fearless, and frequently feed at once from the hand
  when caught.</p>

  <p>The twittering voice is variously described as a chirp, a squeak, a querulous warble, a
  whistle, a loud clear piping cry, or a shrill screech, while the absence of proper song-muscles
  makes it difficult to credit Gosse's statement that <i>Mellisuga minima</i> utters a weak, sweet
  warble, lasting for ten minutes.<a id="NtA_249" href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The nest is usually a moderately deep, round or oval cup-like structure, which may be no larger
  than a walnut-shell; this is formed of the cottony down of plants, moss, wool, or like materials,
  felted into an extremely light and spongy mass, and often decorated externally with lichens,
  cobwebs, shreds of bark, or even feathers and dry leaves. It is placed in a small fork, saddled
  upon a bough, hung from creepers, laced among branchlets, or exceptionally fastened to thatch. In
  <i>Rhamphodon</i>, <i>Pha&euml;thornis</i>, <i>Cephalolepis</i>, <i>Heliothrix</i>, and possibly
  elsewhere, a fabric of very delicate twigs, fibres, and bark is attached to the lower part of a
  palm or similar leaf, several rings of supporting fibre encircling the portion near the stalk, and
  spiders' webs or silky threads aiding to sustain the sides of the structure, which in depth and
  make recalls that of the Reed-Warbler. <i>Oreotrochilus</i> forms a peculiar "hammock" of moss,
  grass, and so forth, attached by like contrivances to rocks; or at times suspends a mass of wool,
  hair, moss, and feathers, as large as a child's head, with a small depression above for the eggs,
  from pendent roots, tendrils, or creepers. This is said to be weighted on either side, if
  necessary, with small stones or morsels of earth, and is repaired for use in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page432"><span class="smaller">{432}</span></span>successive years. Humming-birds never lay
  more than two eggs, and sometimes only one; these are plain dull white, and similarly shaped at
  both ends. The young are hatched blind and naked, and are then about the size of humble bees: but
  they leave the nest comparatively soon, and are precocious as regards flight. The duration of
  incubation, which is apparently not shared by the male, is variously stated at ten, twelve, or
  even more days, and two broods are said to be reared in a season; the first point is clearly
  doubtful; but, considering the extent of the season fit for nidification, the latter is not
  improbable. The parents have been known to add to a nest, as the young outgrew it. The cock courts
  the hen most assiduously, circling around her with dilated throat and swelling plumage, and
  searching for food to offer, while he carefully watches over her when sitting. Humming-birds have
  been often said to be killed with water in place of lead, but in truth diminutive pellets of the
  latter are used, as an alternative to the blow-pipe with its clay ball, or to bird-lime. Immense
  quantities are exported for decorative purposes, and the Mexicans make pictures of the
  feathers.</p>

  <p>The late Mr. Salvin, who divided the Family into groups by the serration of the beak,<a
  id="NtA_250" href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> recognised a hundred and twenty-seven genera with
  some five hundred species, while Audubon, Bates, Gosse, Gould, Mulsant, Wilson and Waterton, Count
  Berlepsch, Messrs. Elliot, Hartert, Ridgway, and Wallace may be mentioned among other
  Trochilidists. The largest form, <i>Patagona gigas</i>, measures nearly nine inches, <i>Mellisuga
  minima</i> and others about two and a half.</p>

  <p>(1) Forms with distinctly serrated beaks. <i>Heliothrix</i> of Central and South America
  southward to Brazil contains three members with wedge-shaped bills and blue tufts behind the ears.
  The females differ little from the males in colour, but have longer tails. <i>Augastes</i>
  contains the two "Vizor-bearers" of South-East Brazil, so-called from the appearance of the head
  and throat; <i>A. lumachellus</i> is bronzy green, with a very brilliant green throat terminated
  by a red line, a little blue shewing between these two colours; the crown is velvety black, the
  pectoral band white, the tail bright bronzy-red. The female is less highly coloured and has a
  green head. <i>Rhamphodon naevius</i> of the same country, and <i>Androdon aequatorialis</i> of
  Colombia and Ecuador, have the bill strongly hooked; the latter is brownish-green above and
  greyish below, with a blue nape and white rump-bar.</p>

  <p><i>Chlorostilbon</i>, ranging from Mexico to Argentina, possesses some dozen green species with
  blue or purplish tails, which are forked or rounded; <i>Panychlora</i> of Colombia and Venezuela
  is similar; <i>Sporadinus</i>, differing in its bronzy-black rectrices, inhabits Florida, the
  Bahamas, and the greater Antilles. In <i>Aithurus polytmus</i>, peculiar to Jamaica, the two
  tail-feathers next to the outer pair are immensely elongated, and, after crossing one another,
  bend outwards in a curve; the lateral rectrices are bluish-black, as is the head with its divided
  crest; all the other parts being luminous green, and the bill red with black tip. The female is
  chiefly green above and white below, with brownish crown. The two species of <i>Microchera</i> of
  Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua, change with the light from coppery-red to black, and have a
  greenish throat, a white crown, and a partly white tail, except the median feathers. The hen is
  green above and white below. <i>Lampornis</i>, with about ten species, ranges from South Mexico
  and the West Indies to Brazil. <i>L. violicauda</i>, the South American "Mango," is green with
  velvety black abdomen and throat, the latter being edged with blue; the lateral rectrices are
  violet. <i>Avocettula recurvirostris</i> of Guiana, with its golden green coloration, emerald
  breast, and tail fiery red beneath in the male, has an upturned tip to the bill, recalling that of
  the Avocet. The female is chiefly white below. <i>Eulampis holosericeus</i>, extending from
  Barbados to St. Thomas, is golden-green, <span class="pagenum" id="page434"><span
  class="smaller">{434}</span></span>with glittering blue tail-coverts and chest; the rectrices are
  steel-blue, the wings and abdomen blackish. <i>E. jugularis</i>, of the Windward Islands, has
  green wings and red throat. <i>Petasophora</i> contains some seven members, ranging from South
  Mexico to Bolivia and Brazil, with fine blue or purple ear-tufts, which occasionally meet in
  front. <i>Chrysolampis mosquitus</i>, extending from New Granada to Guiana and Brazil, with
  Trinidad, is often called the Ruby-and-Topaz Humming-bird, from its ruby-red head and nape, and
  topaz-orange throat and breast; the upper surface is velvety brown, the tail chestnut, the abdomen
  olive. The plumage of the male is largely used for decoration; but the female is chiefly dull
  bronzy-green with whitish lower parts.</p>

  <p>(2) Forms with feebly serrated beaks. The large musky-scented <i>Pterophanes temmincki</i>, of
  the Andes from Colombia to Bolivia, is dark green, with the whole wing blue above and below,
  except for its black tip. The hen-bird is rufous beneath and has purplish-black remiges.
  <i>Diphlogaena iris</i>, the lovely fork-tailed Rainbow, has a golden-green forehead, an
  orange-scarlet crown with a rich violet-blue median stripe, a black nape, a lustrous lilac
  throat-spot, a chestnut rump-region, tail and abdomen, and green plumage elsewhere. The female has
  little or no copper or blue tints. This species inhabits the Andes from Ecuador to Bolivia, and
  has two similar congeners. <i>Cyanolesbia gorgo</i> of Colombia and Venezuela is green, with the
  throat sapphire-blue and the tail violet-blue in the male, these parts being white and nearly
  green respectively in the hen, which has the under parts chestnut. <i>Sappho</i>, of Peru,
  Bolivia, Chili, and Argentina, includes two exceptionally lovely birds with long forked tails and
  luminous throats. <i>S. sparganura</i>, the "Sappho Comet," is bronzy-green with crimson back and
  fiery orange rectrices, which are black at the tip and brown at the base. <i>S. phaon</i> has both
  the above parts lustrous crimson. The females have short tails and lack the red back. The four
  members of <i>Lesbia</i>, another genus with a long forked tail, occupy the Andes from Colombia
  and Venezuela to Bolivia; <i>L. victoriae</i>, the "Train-bearer" of Bogota, being golden green
  with glittering throat and purplish-black tail tipped with green; the hen is green and white
  below, and has the narrow rectrices shorter. <i>Metallura</i>, with about nine species, is found
  in the same countries. <i>Eustephanus galeritus</i> of Chili, the Straits of Magellan, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page435"><span class="smaller">{435}</span></span>and Juan Fernandez, which
  haunts damp shady spots, is bronzy-green, with fiery red crown, and greyish-white under parts
  spotted with green. The female has the crown green. <i>E. fernandensis</i> inhabits Juan
  Fernandez, and <i>E. leyboldi</i> Masafuera. <i>Panterpe insignis</i> of Costa Rica is
  bluish-green, with glittering blue crown and breast, blue-black tail, and bright scarlet throat
  shading into orange laterally. <i>Cyanomyia verticalis</i> of Mexico is brownish-green above and
  white below, with shining cobalt head and sides of the neck, and a reddish bill. The hen has a
  duller crown. <i>Amazilia</i> contains some thirty diverse members ranging from North Mexico to
  Peru, Guiana, Trinidad, and Tobago. <i>A. pristina</i> of Peru is greenish-bronze, with chestnut
  sides, rump, and tail, emerald throat, and white middle to the breast and abdomen. <i>A.
  cyanura</i> of Guatemala and Nicaragua is entirely green, though bluer towards the tail, and
  shining below. <i>Cyanophaea caeruleigularis</i> of Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia is bright
  green, with glittering violet-blue chest. <i>Hylocharis</i> ranges from Guiana to South Brazil,
  <i>H. sapphirina</i> being deep green, with bronzy rump and tail, chestnut chin, sapphire-blue
  throat and breast. The female is whitish below with little blue.</p>

  <p>(3) Forms with smooth beaks. <i>Eutoxeres</i>, which has the bill curved almost into a
  semi-circle, was placed by Gould with <i>Rhamphodon</i> and <i>Pha&euml;thornis</i> in a Sub-family
  <i>Pha&euml;thornithinae</i>, as opposed to <i>Trochilinae</i>, but this has not been generally
  accepted. The sixteen or more species of <i>Pha&euml;thornis</i>, extending from South Mexico to
  Bolivia and Brazil, are often termed "Hermits" from their sombre tints of dull green, grey, and
  brown, or from their habit of frequenting dark forest-recesses. The tail is cuneate and the claws
  rather large. <i>Eupetomena macrura</i> of Brazil and Guiana, termed the "Swallow-tail" from its
  forking rectrices, has the two outer primaries in the male with curved and dilated shafts; the
  three outer feathers being similar in <i>Campylopterus</i> and <i>Sphenoproctus</i>, which range
  through Central America, and in the last case northern South America. The members of these three
  genera are denominated "Sabre-wings." The above species is green, with deep cobalt head and
  throat, and steel-blue tail. <i>Eugenes fulgens</i> of South Arizona, Mexico, and Guatemala is
  bronzy-green changing to black, the throat being lustrous green, and the crown rich violet. The
  female has a brownish crown, and greyish lower surface. <i>E. spectabilis</i> of Costa Rica is
  similar. <span class="pagenum" id="page436"><span class="smaller">{436}</span></span><i>Docimastes
  ensifer</i> of Colombia and Ecuador, which has a straight bill, longer than the head and body
  together, is coppery-green, with black cheeks and throat, and glittering green breast; the last
  being green and white in the hen. <i>Florisuga mellivora</i>, the Jacobin, occurring from South
  Mexico to Amazonia, is green, with the head and entire neck blue, the base of the hind-neck, the
  abdomen, and the middle of the lateral rectrices white. The female is chiefly green, varied with
  white below. <i>Topaza pella</i>, the "Crimson Topaz" or "King Humming-bird" of Guiana, is
  golden-red above, with greenish-orange rump, dark purple and cinnamon wings, and rufous lateral
  rectrices. The two median tail-feathers are bronzy with black tips; the next pair, which are
  elongated and curve outwards, are purplish-black; the throat is lustrous golden; the narrow
  pectoral band is black; the remaining lower parts are crimson. The hen is grass-green, with
  crimson on the throat, and black and cinnamon on the outer tail-feathers. The nest has been stated
  to be made of a fungus, and certainly the appearance justifies the assertion; but Dr. Paul, a
  great authority on Fungi, writes of an example which he brought home for the author from the
  Pomeroon river:&ndash;"The felt is formed of the fluff which clothes the young flower-spathes of
  the Kokerite Palm (<i>Maximiliana martiana</i>)," and his evidence ought to settle the question.
  <i>T. pyra</i>, of the Rio Negro and Eastern Ecuador, is redder above, with no cinnamon on the
  wings or lateral rectrices. The genus <i>Oreotrochilus</i>, and the four next succeeding, have
  particularly strong feet. In common with some half a dozen congeners which range southwards to
  Chili, <i>O. pichincha</i> of Ecuador inhabits the cloudy regions of the Andes near the snow-line;
  it is olive-green above, and has an entirely violet-blue head and throat, the latter being
  followed by a black line and white lower parts, while the lateral tail-feathers are steel-blue and
  white. The female is green above, ashy and white below. <i>Oreonympha nobilis</i> of Peru, which
  has a peculiar habit of suddenly stopping in its flight, is a large bird with somewhat forking
  rectrices. The main colour is bronzy-brown, with a blue crown divided in the centre by a brown
  bar; the black of the cheeks runs to a point below; the chin is green and the beard crimson; the
  lower parts are greyish-white; the tail has the external pair of feathers white. The hen has a
  brown and greenish crown and a black throat. <i>Oxypogon guerini</i> of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page437"><span class="smaller">{437}</span></span>Colombia, the "Warrior" or "Helmet-crest,"
  is dark green, with blackish sides to the head, a black and white crest, a green and white chin
  margined with black, a white beard, a greyish abdomen, and purplish and white lateral rectrices.
  The female lacks the elongated feathers, and has white under parts spotted with dusky.
  <i>Rhamphomicron heteropogon</i> of Colombia, one of the sharp-beaked "Thornbills," is
  greenish-bronze, with browner tail and abdomen, and a long amethystine beard surrounded by
  bronzy-black. <i>R. microrhynchum</i>, having rich purple upper parts and a lustrous green throat,
  extends to Ecuador, while other members of the genus range to Bolivia. The hens are comparatively
  dull. <i>Opisthoprora euryptera</i> of Colombia, which is bronzy-green with a little rufous and
  white below, has an upcurved bill, like <i>Avocettula</i>. <i>Patagona gigas</i>, the largest
  Humming-bird known, inhabits the Andes from Ecuador to Chili; it is greenish-brown, with white
  rump and rufous under parts. In <i>Aglaeactis</i>, of the Andes from Colombia to Bolivia, the
  coloration is brown, dark buff, or black, with glittering amethystine or green lower back, and a
  white or buff pectoral tuft. The chief marvel of the Family is, however, <i>Loddigesia
  mirabilis</i>, originally found in Northern Peru by a botanist named Matthews, and rediscovered by
  M. Stolzmann<a id="NtA_251" href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> in almost the same locality. It is
  shining bronzy-green, with whitish under parts surrounding a black central area; the head and its
  crest are lustrous cobalt-blue, the throat is emerald-green with black margin, the metatarsi are
  covered with white feathers. The two lateral rectrices are extraordinarily prolonged, and resemble
  black wires with large steel-blue terminal discs; the shafts normally cross each other at their
  bases and again near their tips, but the discs are frequently brought together in flight, or
  extended horizontally, if not turned above the head. The median tail-feathers are much reduced.
  The female is green, varied with white below; the external pair of steel-blue lateral rectrices
  shewing small spatules. <i>Cephalolepis delalandi</i>, of South-East Brazil, is bronzy-green
  above, and fine violet-blue bordered with grey below, while the long glittering green crest
  terminates in a single black plume. The crestless hen is grey below. <i>Eriocnemis</i>, of the
  Andes from Colombia and Venezuela to Bolivia, shares with <i>Panoplites</i> and the
  spatulate-tailed <i>Spathura</i> of the same regions the characteristic of possessing <span
  class="pagenum" id="page438"><span class="smaller">{438}</span></span>muff-like tufts of black,
  white, or buff, which cover the metatarsi. To take an example of the twenty or more species, where
  the sexes are fairly similar, <i>E. cupreiventris</i> is bronzy-green, with brighter under
  surface, purplish-black tail, reddish abdomen, and lustrous blue under tail-coverts. <i>Calothorax
  lucifer</i>, the "Mexican Star," is golden-green above and white below, with shining lilac-red
  throat; it has purplish-black lateral rectrices tipped with white, of which the outer is filiform,
  as are the external four in <i>Acestrura</i> of northern South America. <i>Selasphorus rufus</i>,
  of western North America, from Alaska to Mexico, is cinnamon above and white below, with
  golden-green crown and glittering red throat; the head-feathers are bordered with rufous, and the
  sub-median tail-feathers are emarginate. The female has chiefly green upper and white under parts.
  <i>S. platycercus</i>, resembling the next species, but with a rosy-red throat, occupies the Rocky
  Mountains and extends to Guatemala, the genus reaching Panama. They constantly have the outer
  primary or outer rectrix attenuated. <i>Trochilus colubris</i>, found at different seasons from
  the Fur Countries and the Great Plains to Guatemala, is green above and whitish below, the chin
  being black, the throat glittering ruby-red, and the forked tail chiefly bluish-black. The hen
  lacks the red colour. <i>T. alexandri</i> of western North America differs in its violet-purple
  throat. <i>Calypte annae</i> and <i>C. costae</i> of the South-West United States are green birds
  with mainly whitish lower surface, and have the crown and throat rosy and lilac respectively. The
  latter form has elongated gular plumes, as has the bluer Cuban <i>C. helenae</i>, where they are
  crimson. The minute <i>Mellisuga minima</i>, or "Bee Humming-bird," of Jamaica and San Domingo is
  green above and white below, with dusky throat-spots in the male. The equally small
  <i>Chaetocercus bombus</i> of Ecuador is green, with rosy throat, buff breast, and chiefly
  purplish-black rectrices, of which the outer four are short and spiny; the female is green above
  and cinnamon below.</p>

  <p><i>Thaumastura cora</i>, the "Peruvian Sheartail," is golden-green, with crimson throat shading
  into blue, and white under surface; the black and white tail has two enormously elongated
  sub-median feathers. The hen is white below, with buffish throat and flanks. <i>Prymnacantha
  popelairii</i>, one of another group of Thornbills (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page437">437</a></span>), has a yellowish-green crest with two long black filamentous
  plumes; the upper parts are bronzy-green with a white rump; the lower parts are black, with a
  glittering green <span class="pagenum" id="page439"><span
  class="smaller">{439}</span></span>throat and rufous tibiae. The forked tail has the pointed
  narrow feathers steel-blue with white shafts. The hen has a dark green crown and black and white
  throat. This genus extends from Costa Rica to Bolivia and Brazil. <i>Lophornis</i> covers the same
  area, but reaches Mexico. <i>L. ornatus</i> has beautiful fawn-coloured tufts with green terminal
  spots, on the sides of the neck; and is chiefly bright green and cinnamon, with a rufous and
  purplish rump and a chestnut crest; the female exhibits more white below and lacks the crest and
  tufts. The remaining half score of species are similar or even more brilliant. <i>Heliactin
  cornuta</i> of Brazil alone of the Family has resplendent purple, green, and gold tufts above and
  behind the eyes. The coloration is shining green, with a bluer crown, black cheeks and throat, and
  white lower parts. The hen is green above and white below, with buff throat.</p>

  <p>Fam. XIII. <b>Coliidae.</b>&ndash;This group is the only constituent of the Sub-Order <span
  class="sc">Colii</span> or Colies, termed Mouse-birds in South Africa from their creeping habits.
  They were formerly classed among the Passerine Fringillidae, to which they bear a certain outward
  resemblance, while at a later date a partial study of the anatomy seemed to point to an affinity
  with the Plantain-eaters; but it is now generally recognised that they should be placed among
  those Families which in this work form the Order Coraciiformes. They are small, tough-skinned
  birds, which would appear larger were it not for the short, dense feathering; the bill is stout
  and Finch-like, the long metatarsus exhibits one series of scutes in front, and reticulations
  behind; the toes with their slender claws are all directed forwards, but the hallux and apparently
  the outer toe can be turned backwards. The wings are weak and rounded, with ten primaries and nine
  secondaries; the very long tail has ten rectrices, the outer pair not being greatly developed. The
  furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the syrinx has one pair of tracheo-bronchial
  muscles; the tongue is flat and cartilaginous with horny papillae; an after-shaft is present; the
  adults, and probably the nestlings, have no down.</p>

  <p>Colies frequent forest-districts, especially where the bush is thick; they are active, yet not
  very shy, and are usually found, except during the breeding season, in flocks of some six to eight
  individuals. The flight is laboured, with many a quick beat of the wings; but it is direct and
  fairly rapid, though seldom sustained beyond some neighbouring tree, where the bird may be seen
  stealing <span class="pagenum" id="page440"><span class="smaller">{440}</span></span>through the
  foliage, and aiding its creeping movements with its bill. The most peculiar habit, however, is
  that of climbing with the whole metatarsus applied to the branch, a fact which adds greatly to the
  mouse-like appearance. When roosting, Colies are said to pack themselves together in masses, and
  to hang by the feet; rarely are they seen perching or hopping, though they often cling to the
  boughs with the head downwards. The note is disagreeable and harsh. The cup-shaped nest of twigs,
  roots, and grass, with a lining of wool or finer grasses, is placed in thick bushes, or near the
  ground in low trees; the three or four eggs, hardly pointed at either end, are dull white,
  sometimes streaked with orange or brown. Fresh leaves are not uncommonly added below them. The
  food consists almost entirely of fruit, though green shoots, or even insects, are believed to be
  occasionally eaten.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The eight or nine species of the single genus <i>Colius</i>, ranging through the
  whole Ethiopian region except Madagascar, vary in coloration from brown with darker vermiculations
  or bars to <span class="pagenum" id="page441"><span class="smaller">{441}</span></span>grey or
  ash-colour, the abdomen being buff. Fine crests add to the general appearance. <i>C. macrurus</i>
  is remarkable for a tuft of blue feathers on each side of the nape; <i>C. leucocephalus</i> has a
  white head; <i>C. leucotis</i> white ear-coverts; <i>C. nigricollis</i> a black forehead and
  throat; <i>C. capensis</i> two stripes of black on the back enclosing one of white; while that
  species and <i>C. castanonotus</i> have maroon rumps. The bare skin surrounding the eye is scarlet
  in <i>C. erythromelon</i>, <i>C. macrurus</i>, and <i>C. capensis</i>, and apparently bluish-grey
  elsewhere. The legs are red in life, fading to buff after death. <i>C. striatus</i> is very nearly
  uniform brown, <i>C. erythromelon</i> shews a greenish tinge and has some buff on the head. The
  sexes are similar, nor are the young very different. The length is from eleven to fourteen inches.
  Kafirs consider these birds very good eating.</p>

  <p>Fam. XIV. <b>Trogonidae.</b>&ndash;The Trogons are the sole tenants of the Sub-Order <span
  class="sc">Trogones</span>, a very distinct group of birds of brilliant coloration&ndash;the
  Quezal, as will be seen below, being the most splendid of all. Their general aspect is somewhat
  heavy; the neck is abbreviated; the bill, stoutest in <i>Pharomacrus</i> and most slender in
  <i>Euptilotis</i>, is short and strong, with a wide bristly gape, and a curved culmen terminating
  in a hook. The maxilla in these genera, as well as in <i>Harpactes</i> and <i>Hapalarpactes</i>,
  has a terminal notch, while both mandibles are more or less serrated in adults of <i>Trogon</i>,
  <i>Hapaloderma</i>, <i>Tmetotrogon</i>, and <i>Prionotelus</i>. The foot is comparatively small
  and weak, with the short metatarsus feathered and somewhat scaly; the second toe is reversed, a
  heterodactylous arrangement (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page10">10</a></span>) unique among
  birds. The moderate wing has ten primaries, and from eight to ten secondaries; the upper
  wing-coverts being elongated in <i>Pharomacrus</i>, especially in the males. The long rectrices
  are twelve in number, and are concave at the end with divergent tips in <i>Prionotelus</i>; the
  feathers, moreover, are often square at the extremity&ndash;a noticeable peculiarity in the
  Family; while in the Quezal, <i>Pharomacrus mocinno</i>, the male has enormously developed upper
  coverts to the tail, which extend far beyond it, the two median being the longest; in its
  congeners and in females generally they equal the rectrices; in <i>Euptilotis</i> they are only
  half the length. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the tongue flat; the
  syrinx tracheo-bronchial; the aftershaft long; the nostrils are bristly; the adults have no down;
  and the nestlings are said to be naked for a short period. The large soft <span class="pagenum"
  id="page442"><span class="smaller">{442}</span></span>feathers are easily detached from the
  delicate skin. The male of <i>Pharomacrus mocinno</i> has a fine rounded crest, less developed in
  the female and in its other congeners. <i>Euptilotis</i>, <i>Tmetotrogon</i>, and
  <i>Prionotelus</i> have the ear-coverts filamentous and hair-like. <i>Pharomacrus pavoninus</i>
  has a red bill, as has <i>Prionotelus</i> in part; the usual colour in the former genus, and in
  <i>Trogon</i> and its allies, being yellow for the cock and more horn-coloured or black for the
  hen, but in <i>Harpactes</i> violet or bluish, with a duller tip in the female. The orbits are
  partially or entirely bare in <i>Hapaloderma</i>, <i>Harpactes</i>, and <i>Hapalarpactes</i>, the
  skin being, it would seem, yellow, violet, or blue. The Family ranges through the tropical
  portions of the Indian, Ethiopian, and Neotropical Regions, <i>Harpactes</i> and
  <i>Hapalarpactes</i> being found in the first, <i>Hapaloderma</i> in the second, and the other
  five genera in the third. <i>Trogon ambiguus</i> reaches northwards to Arizona and Texas. The
  number of species is nearly fifty, of which the largest (<i>Pharomacrus mocinno</i>) measures some
  fourteen inches, the smallest (<i>Harpactes duvauceli</i>) about nine.</p>

  <p>Trogons are usually seen singly or in pairs, though sometimes in small flocks; they are rarely
  shy, and often so unsuspicious that they may be killed with a stick. They customarily sit almost
  motionless in the mid-day heat, with the head drawn in upon the shoulders and the body vertical,
  every now and then opening and shutting the tail. Their haunts are in the thickest forests, which
  they seldom leave for more open or sunny places; here they creep about the trees or sit some
  half-way up on leafless branches, darting off to catch a passing insect or to secure a tempting
  fruit, since nearly all their food is taken on the wing. The noiseless flight is rapid, but short
  and jerky, with occasional undulations. The Quezal, at least, clings to trees like a Woodpecker,
  but the feet are ill adapted to climbing, and perfectly unfit for walking. The voice of this
  species consists of two plaintive sibilant notes, gradually swelling into a loud cry, and varied
  by discordant sounds; many forms, however, utter a reiterated "cou-cou," and will also cluck,
  whistle, or chatter, though ordinarily silent, except when breeding. The food of the New World
  species is stated to consist principally of fruit, but lizards, grasshoppers, lepidoptera,
  caterpillars, ants, beetles, small crabs, and terrestrial molluscs are eaten; while the Old World
  forms seem to prefer an insect-diet. No nest is made, but a hole is usually bored or enlarged in
  the top or side of a rotten stump or branch, in which <span class="pagenum" id="page443"><span
  class="smaller">{443}</span></span>are deposited from two to four roundish eggs of a white,
  bluish, greenish, or buff colour. <i>Trogon surucura</i> has been observed clinging to a
  tree-trunk and excavating a cavity in an ants' nest. The male at times incubates. The flesh is not
  unpalatable.</p>

  <p><i>Hapalarpactes reinwardti</i> of Java is dark bluish-green above with a more olive crown, and
  yellow below with orange abdomen; the primaries are black and white, the secondaries and their
  coverts green with yellow bars, the rectrices purplish as compared with the back, the lateral pair
  freely marked with white. The female has brown instead of yellow on the wing. <i>H. mackloti</i>
  of Sumatra has the rump chestnut in the male. The genus <i>Harpactes</i> ranges from India and
  Ceylon to Cochin China, the Indo-Malay Islands, and the Philippines. <i>H. kasumba</i> has the
  crown, throat, and chest black, the nuchal collar and under parts crimson, while a white band
  divides the two colours below; the upper parts are orange-rufous; the two median rectrices
  chestnut tipped with black; the rest of the tail and the wings black and white. The hen is brown
  above, becoming rufous towards the rump; the throat and chest are grey, the remaining lower
  surface and the wing-markings buff. <i>H. orescius</i> has an olive-yellow head, a brilliant
  orange breast, and a chestnut back; the female being more sombre. <i>Hapaloderma narina</i>,
  ranging from North-East Africa to Cape Colony and thence to Angola, is brilliant bronzy-green
  above; the wings and tail are black and white with a blue and green wash, the secondaries and
  wing-coverts being vermiculated with white; the chest is green; the breast and abdomen are
  crimson. The hen has the throat and chest brown, the breast duller. <i>H. constantia</i> extends
  from the Calabar River to Fantee, <i>H. vittatum</i> is East African. The genus <i>Trogon</i> is
  found from South Arizona and Texas to North Argentina. <i>T. mexicanus</i> is bronzy-green above
  and on the chest, the sides of the head and the throat being black, and the remaining under parts
  crimson, surmounted by a white band; the wings are blackish with white vermiculations on the
  secondaries and coverts; the two median rectrices are green with black tips, the others black and
  white. The female has the chest and upper surface, including that of the tail, brown, the
  wing-vermiculations buff. <i>T. surucura</i> has the most southerly range of the two dozen
  species. <i>Prionotelus temnurus</i>, peculiar to Cuba, has the sexes similar; the upper parts are
  bronzy-green, the head is black, glossed with purple and blue, the under parts are grey with
  crimson abdomen.</p>

  <p>The six middle tail-feathers are bronzy-green, tinged with purple, the remainder and the wings
  black and white. In <i>Tmetotrogon rhodogaster</i>, restricted to San Domingo, the upper surface
  is bronzy-green, the lower grey with crimson abdomen. The blackish wings have white-edged
  primaries, the median pair of rectrices are purple and green, the others purplish-blue. The female
  has white bars on the upper wing-coverts. <i>Euptilotis neoxenus</i> of Mexico has a
  greenish-black head and throat, and a crimson breast and abdomen, while the rest of the plumage is
  bronzy-green, except for the black and white wings and the six purplish-black median rectrices.
  The hen has a greyish head, throat, and chest. <i>Pharomacrus mocinno</i>, the Quezal of the
  higher districts from Guatemala to Veragua, is brilliant iridescent green above, tinged with blue
  on the far extended tail-coverts; the throat is green, the under parts are gorgeous crimson, the
  remiges and the six median rectrices are black, the remainder chiefly white. A full crest and
  elongated wing-coverts add to the bird's appearance. The female has the long feathers less
  developed; the head and under surface brownish-grey, with a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page445"><span class="smaller">{445}</span></span>green tinge on the former and on the chest;
  the vent crimson. Three other species range from Colombia to Bolivia. The decorative feathers of
  the Quezal were reserved for chiefs in olden times.</p>

  <p>Trogons are ancient forms which once occurred within the Palaearctic countries, as is shewn by
  the discovery of the fossil <i>Trogon gallicus</i> in the Lower Miocene of France.</p>

  <p>The Sub-Order <span class="sc">Pici</span> contains, according to Dr. Gadow, the Families
  <i>Galbulidae</i>, or Jacamars and Puff-birds, <i>Capitonidae</i>, or Barbets and Honey-guides,
  <i>Rhamphastidae</i> or Toucans, and <i>Picidae</i>, or Woodpeckers and Wrynecks. All these
  undoubtedly belong to that author's Order Coraciiformes, though Garrod and W. A. Forbes included
  the <i>Galbulidae</i> and several of the allied Families in their Passeriformes.</p>

  <p>Fam. XV. <b>Galbulidae.</b><a id="NtA_252" href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a>&ndash;This may
  be divided into the Sub-families, (1) <i>Galbulinae</i>, or Jacamars, and (2) <i>Bucconinae</i>,
  or Puff-birds.<a id="NtA_253" href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> The former have a long straight
  bill, compressed and pointed, with angular genys; <i>Jacamerops</i>, however, having it curved,
  ridged, and dilated basally. The feet are weak, the metatarsi being scutellated in front and
  smooth behind, with the toes zygodactylous; while <i>Jacamaralcyon</i> alone lacks the hallux. The
  rounded wings have ten primaries, with the outer much reduced, and from ten to twelve secondaries;
  the tail of twelve feathers is sometimes short and square, sometimes long and more or less
  graduated, the external pair of rectrices being diminutive or absent. The furcula is <span
  class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the tongue long, tapering, and membranous; the nostrils are
  slightly bristly, with an internal membrane in <i>Jacamerops</i>; the aftershaft is rudimentary;
  and there is no down on the adults or the blind nestlings. The plumage is particularly soft.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Galbulinae</i>.&ndash;Jacamars are ordinarily brilliant coppery- or golden-green
  above, and more or less rufous below; though the upper parts may be metallic blue, chestnut, or
  greyish-black. The bill and feet are generally blackish; but in <i>Galbalcyrhynchus</i>,
  <i>Brachygalba albigularis</i>, and <i>B. melanosterna</i>, the bill is white, in <i>Galbula
  albirostris</i> and <i>G. cyaneicollis</i> it is yellow and black. The largest species
  (<i>Jacamerops grandis</i>) is not eleven inches long. The females resemble the males, or are
  paler below, <span class="pagenum" id="page446"><span class="smaller">{446}</span></span>and lack
  the usual white throat. The Sub-family ranges from Mexico to South Brazil.</p>

  <p>These birds are usually found towards the outskirts of forests near water, where they frequent
  lofty trees, and commonly sit crouched upon some dead or slender branch for hours, merely moving
  the head from time to time. The food consists of insects&ndash;especially flies or
  moths&ndash;which are often caught upon the wing, and crushed against the boughs before they are
  swallowed, the bird sallying forth and returning to its perch like a Fly-catcher. The regular note
  is short and seldom heard; but <i>Jacamaralcyon</i> has, according to the natives, an agreeable
  whistling song. The flight is quick and jerky. Generally found solitary or in pairs, the various
  species occasionally bathe in small flocks. The three or more roundish white eggs are laid in
  holes in banks, or possibly in old stumps. In some districts names equivalent to "Large
  Humming-birds" are given to Jacamars; while early writers confounded them with Kingfishers.</p>

  <p><i>Urogalba paradisea</i> of Guiana, Peru, and Brazil, and <i>U. amazonum</i> of Upper
  Amazonia, characterized by an extremely long and tapering median pair of tail-feathers, are dark
  blue, with bronzy and green reflexions, brownish heads, and white throats. Seven out of ten
  members of the genus <i>Galbula</i> are also Amazonian; the remainder reaching South Mexico,
  Bolivia, and South-East Brazil, and one of them Trinidad and Tobago. <i>G. albirostris</i> is
  brilliant bronzy-green above, with rufous lower parts and white throat; most of its congeners
  being fairly similar, though <i>G. chalcothorax</i> has a decided red and blue gloss on both
  surfaces and a white abdomen. <i>Brachygalba</i>, which extends from Colombia to Amazonia,
  includes six diminutive forms, with a varying admixture of green and brown above, of black, brown,
  rufous and white below. <i>Jacamaralcyon tridactyla</i> of South-East Brazil is greenish-black,
  with a brown, rufous-streaked head, and a white mid-breast and abdomen. <i>Galbalcyrhynchus
  leucotis</i> of East Ecuador and Upper Amazonia is chestnut, with white cheeks and darker head and
  quills. <i>Jacamerops grandis</i>, ranging from Veragua to Amazonia and Ecuador, is bright
  coppery-green, with blackish wings and tail, a white throat-patch, and a chestnut abdomen.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Bucconinae.</i>&ndash;The Puff-birds differ structurally from the
  <i>Galbulinae</i> only in having shorter and stouter beaks, with hooked or incurved tips; stronger
  metatarsi, which are scaly behind; fully developed lateral rectrices; and no aftershaft. The
  habits of the two groups are similar, while the aforesaid English name probably refers to the
  puffy appearance of the head while the birds are resting. They are black, brown, or rufous in hue,
  relieved by white markings; the bill being red in <i>Bucco chacuru</i>, <i>B. maculatus</i>, <i>B.
  striatipectus</i>, and <i>B. collaris</i>, and red or yellow in <i>Monacha</i>. The entire range
  of the Family, extending from Guatemala and Honduras to Argentina, is occupied by the twenty
  hook-billed species of <i>Bucco</i>. <i>B. dysoni</i> is blue-black, with a white under surface
  crossed by a broad black band, and a white forehead and nape; <i>B. hyperrhynchus</i> is similar
  with a larger bill; <i>B. collaris</i> differs in its rusty-red upper parts barred with black;
  <i>B. bicinctus</i> has these mottled with brown, and two black bands on its buff breast; <i>B.
  maculatus</i> has a rufous chest and black spots on the white belly; and so forth. The half-dozen
  species of <i>Malacoptila</i>, extending from Guatemala to Brazil, are brownish birds, striated
  with rufous; the lower parts being more or less fulvous, often with black and white breast-bands.
  The diminutive <i>Micromonacha lanceolata</i> of Upper Amazonia is rufescent above; the forehead
  and under parts are relieved by black, while each outer rectrix has a black bar. The Nunlets
  (<i>Nonnula rubecula</i> and its congeners) are also among the smallest of the Family, and are
  distributed from Panama to Peru and Brazil; they are brown above and ferruginous beneath, with a
  little white. <i>Hapaloptila castanea</i> of Colombia and Ecuador is a hook-billed species, with
  olive-grey upper and chestnut under parts, a white forehead and throat. <i>Monacha</i> comprises
  about seven large blue-black forms, ranging from Nicaragua to South-East Brazil and Bolivia, some
  of which have white on the wings <span class="pagenum" id="page448"><span
  class="smaller">{448}</span></span>and round the base of the bill. <i>Chelidoptera tenebrosa</i>,
  the Swallow-wing, of Venezuela, Guiana, and Amazonia, has long wings and a short square tail; the
  colour being blue-black, with a chestnut lower abdomen and white tail-coverts. The larger <i>C.
  brasiliensis</i> inhabits Brazil. This is apparently the only member of the group of which the
  nest has been found; it was a mere hole in a bank, containing two shining white eggs.</p>

  <p>Fam. XVI. <b>Capitonidae.</b>&ndash;This is here taken to contain the Sub-families (1)
  <i>Capitoninae</i>, or Barbets, and (2) <i>Indicatorinae</i>, or Honey-guides. Much confusion has
  arisen from the fact that Brisson included the former in his genus <i>Bucco</i>, while
  subsequently Garrod and W. A. Forbes combined the <i>Rhamphastidae</i> (Toucans) with the
  above-mentioned groups in their <i>Capitonidae</i>.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Capitoninae.</i>&ndash;Barbets are heavy, ungraceful birds, with large stout
  bills, which are swollen at the base, occasionally sulcated, and more or less beset with bristles.
  <i>Pogonorhynchus</i> and <i>Tricholaema</i> have the maxilla toothed&ndash;generally strongly,
  while that of <i>Tetragonops</i> fits into a fissure in the truncated tip of the mandible. The
  scutellated feet are fairly powerful, with zygodactylous toes and rather long claws; the moderate
  wings have ten primaries, and ten or eleven secondaries; the tail of ten rectrices is more usually
  short than long, and may be square, rounded, or graduated. The clavicles are somewhat reduced; the
  tongue is said to be thin, short, and cartilaginous; the nostrils are often bristly, an aftershaft
  is present; while both adults and young lack down.</p>

  <p>The brilliant plumage commonly exhibits vivid contrasts of scarlet, blue, purple, or yellow on
  a green ground, but <i>Calorhamphus</i> and <i>Gymnobucco</i> are sombre in hue; different
  species, moreover, have crests, naked orbits, or brightly coloured bills. The sexes are alike,
  except in <i>Capito</i>; the young are duller.</p>

  <p>The members of this Family are strictly arboreal, and inhabit forests, or well-timbered
  cultivated districts and gardens; not being usually shy, or easily disturbed while feeding in
  flocks. The tops of trees are their natural resort, yet pairs frequently descend to the bushes,
  where they hop from branch to branch; they also climb up and down the trunks, and some African
  forms are said thus to search the cracks for insects. The flight is powerful and undulating, but
  Barbets are inactive birds, and often sit motionless for hours, their plaintive whistle, or noisy
  ringing note of two or three syllables being heard at intervals <span class="pagenum"
  id="page449"><span class="smaller">{449}</span></span>throughout the day or on moonlight nights.
  The latter cry is variously syllabled kuttooruk, tok-tok, or poo-poo-poop, while its likeness to
  the sound of striking metal has given the name of "Copper-smith", "Tinker-bird," and "Iron-smith"
  to <i>Xantholaema haematocephala</i>, <i>Barbatula pusilla</i>, and <i>Cyanops faber</i>. While
  uttering their protracted notes Barbets often move their heads from side to side, and certain
  American species jerk their tails over their backs like Toucans. The food consists of fruits of
  every sort, buds and petals of flowers, and even green bark, or in many cases almost entirely of
  insects; in captivity pieces of meat or small birds seem acceptable, the latter being usually
  battered upon some hard substance before being swallowed. When feeding on trees these birds are so
  noiseless that the falling berries alone betray their presence, while they quit the feast with
  great reluctance. They cut neat circular nesting-holes, which turn downwards and widen out below,
  in soft or decaying wood, generally on the under side of a branch; and lay three, four, or even
  five eggs, oval, thin-shelled, white and somewhat shining, on a few chips or sometimes other
  substances. A week or two may be occupied in excavating the cavity, while it is a moot question
  whether the tapping that goes on in spring is made in finding suitable breeding quarters or in
  obtaining insects. Von Heuglin saw two borings in banks. The young accompany their parents for a
  considerable time. Barbets do not thrive well as cage-birds.</p>

  <p>The range extends throughout Tropical Asia, Africa, and America, and even slightly beyond those
  bounds in the two former; but America possesses only the large genus <i>Capito</i> and the two
  species of <i>Tetragonops</i>, whereas the other regions divide the remaining groups fairly evenly
  between them. Captain Shelley<a id="NtA_254" href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> admits nineteen
  genera and a hundred and ten species. The former are difficult to diagnose, and depend largely on
  colour; of the latter the subjoined are merely a few of the most typical or remarkable forms.
  <i>Pogonorhynchus</i> (including <i>Erythrobucco</i> and <i>Melanobucco</i>) and
  <i>Tricholaema</i>, including respectively some fifteen and ten species, are exclusively African
  groups, noticeable for the long, black bristles before the eye and below the beak. <i>P.
  dubius</i> of West Africa has bluish-black upper parts, with a little crimson on the wing-coverts
  and a white dorsal patch; the cheeks and ear-coverts are crimson, separated by a black line; <span
  class="pagenum" id="page450"><span class="smaller">{450}</span></span>the anterior under parts are
  crimson, the posterior scarlet, these being divided by a black pectoral band, and relieved by
  yellowish patches on the sides; the bill is reddish-yellow, the naked orbits are orange.
  <i>Tricholaema leucomelan</i> of South Africa is blue-black above, with plentiful yellow and
  scanty white markings, but white below with black throat. The forehead is crimson, the eyebrow and
  orbits are yellow, the bill is blackish. The breast-feathers have hair-like shafts. <i>Gymnobucco
  calvus</i> of West Africa is brown with paler streaks; having the bill and chin-bristles
  yellowish, and browner bristles round the nostrils in at least one sex. The naked head is blue.
  <i>Barbatula</i>, of the Ethiopian Region generally, contains a dozen small species, which exhibit
  soft loose plumage of black, varied with red, yellow, or white. <i>B. minuta</i>, extending from
  North-East Africa to Senegambia, has the forehead scarlet, the rump and under surface yellowish,
  the bill black, and somewhat scanty bristles. <i>Stactolaema anchietae</i> of Benguela, and <i>S.
  olivaceum</i> of East Africa, are respectively brown with yellowish head and throat, and
  olive-green with those parts blackish. The bill is black. <i>Calorhamphus hayi</i>, found from
  South Tenasserim to Sumatra, is yellowish-brown above and yellowish-white below, with
  black-shafted spiny crown-feathers, rufous throat, black bill, reddish orbits and no
  chin-bristles. <i>C. fuliginosus</i> of Borneo is similar. <i>Megalaema</i>, <i>Chotorhea</i>,
  <i>Cyanops</i> and <i>Mesobucco</i>, with about thirty members in all, extend from India and
  Ceylon to China, Formosa, Hainan, and the Great Sunda Islands. They are soft-plumaged green birds,
  having parti-coloured heads and throats tinted with blue, yellow, red, and black, or merely brown
  and white; the bill and feet are yellowish, greenish, or black. The bristles vary in their
  development. <i>Psilopogon pyrolophus</i>, of the mountains of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, is
  green, with a black forehead, a brownish head crossed by a greyish-white band, and a double belt
  of yellow and black below the green throat. The long nasal bristles are black, tipped with
  scarlet; the superciliary stripe and lower eye-lid are green; the upper eye-lid is yellow; the
  bill is yellowish-green with black central band; the legs and orbits are greenish. The unusually
  long tail is much graduated, and has pointed median rectrices, while these are square in some ten
  Ethiopian species of <i>Trachyphonus</i>, where the tail is similar. <i>T. cafer</i> of South-East
  Africa is bluish-black above with white markings; <span class="pagenum" id="page451"><span
  class="smaller">{451}</span></span>the rump being yellow; the upper tail-coverts scarlet; the
  forehead, sides of the head and lower parts yellow, with a tinge of scarlet on the throat, which
  is followed by a black and white gorget. The fine occipital crest is black, the beak green; the
  feet and orbits are dusky. <i>T. margaritatus</i>, of North-East Africa, has brown upper parts
  with round white spots; the upper and lower tail-coverts are crimson; the rump, head, neck, and
  under surface are yellow, except for the crown and marks on the hind-neck and throat, which are
  black, and for an indistinct chest-band of red, surmounted by one of brown. The beak is red, the
  feet are bluish. The exclusively Central and South American <i>Capito</i> is the only genus in
  which the sexes differ; the dozen or more species have, moreover, few bristles round the bill.
  <i>C. niger</i> of Guiana is black above, varied with yellowish and buff, and sulphur-yellow below
  with a few black spots, which become plentiful in the female. The forehead, cheeks, and throat are
  orange-scarlet, the bill is plumbeous. <i>C. salvini</i> of Costa Rica and Panama has green upper
  and yellow under parts; most of the head and the throat being scarlet, the flanks green and white,
  and a whitish band descending the sides of the neck. The female lacks the scarlet, but has a dull
  golden crown and nape, pale blue cheeks, and an orange gorget below the green throat. The bill is
  greenish-yellow, the orbits are yellowish. <i>Tetragonops rhamphastinus</i> of Ecuador, in which
  the nostrils lie in grooves, has the crown black, with white sides merging gradually into a
  blue-grey throat; a glossy black nuchal crest; a rufous-olive mantle; orange lower back and upper
  tail-coverts; blackish-blue wings and tail; scarlet breast with orange sides; and yellowish-green
  abdomen. The bill is orange-yellow with dusky tip. <i>T. frantzii</i> of Costa Rica, called
  "Gallinita" from its chicken-like cry, has greenish-olive upper and yellowish-green lower parts,
  with golden-orange forehead, cheeks and throat, a plumbeous bill, and a similar crest to its
  congener. This genus bears a certain resemblance to the Toucans.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Indicatorinae.</i>&ndash;The Honey-guides are contained in the two genera
  <i>Indicator</i> and <i>Prodotiscus</i>, with nine and two species respectively, which were
  formerly placed among the Cuckoos. Their chief interest centres in the fact that they are said to
  conduct travellers to bees' nests, as will be seen below.</p>

  <p>From the Capitoninae, <i>Indicator</i> differs in the stout <span class="pagenum"
  id="page452"><span class="smaller">{452}</span></span>Finch-like bill with ridged and laterally
  swollen maxilla, while that of <i>Prodotiscus</i> is more slender and pointed. Moreover, the
  metatarsi are short; the nostrils possess a narrow membrane and are not bristly; and the rectrices
  number twelve, save in the last-named genus, which has ten. The curiously interrupted range
  includes the whole Ethiopian Region, except Madagascar; the Himalayas; and the Malayan and Bornean
  mountains. The sexes are generally similar, while almost all the forms, which hardly exceed a Lark
  in size, are chiefly dull brown, with a yellow wash, and some white on the rump, tail, or
  wings.</p>

  <p><i>Indicator xanthonotus</i> of the Himalayas is blackish above, with golden forehead and
  orange rump-region, and greyish below; the latter colour merging into yellow on the throat and
  black on the abdomen. <i>I. archipelagicus</i> of the Malay Peninsula and Borneo, and <i>I.
  sparrmani</i> of Tropical Africa, except the western forests, exhibit a yellow shoulder-patch;
  while the males of the latter and of <i>I. major</i> of the same districts have black throats,
  which are whitish and yellow in the respective females. <i>I. minor</i>, and the remaining
  Ethiopian species, differ from the last two forms in having no white on the lower back.
  <i>Prodotiscus regulus</i> of Natal, and <i>P. insignis</i>, ranging from the Gaboon to East
  Equatorial Africa, are particularly dull.</p>

  <p>Circumstantial accounts of eye-witnesses so clearly shew that bees' nests are found through the
  instrumentality of these birds, that their intention can hardly be doubted, and it has been said
  that not only man but the ratel (<i>Mellivora capensis</i>) is conducted; the object of
  attraction, however, occasionally turns out to be a leopard, cat, snake, or dog. Honey-guides call
  attention by a shrill cry or hiss, and will even fly in the face of a traveller, as if enraged at
  not being followed; they eat bees, grubs, and honey, and are asserted to lay white eggs in the
  nests of Barbets and the like.<a id="NtA_255" href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> Sir John Kirk
  writes<a id="NtA_256" href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a> of the habits of <i>Indicator
  minor</i>&ndash;"The Honey-guide is found in forests, and often far from water, even during the
  dry season. On observing a man it comes fluttering from branch to branch in the neighbouring
  trees, calling attention. If this be responded to, as the natives do by whistling and starting to
  their feet, the bird will <span class="pagenum" id="page453"><span
  class="smaller">{453}</span></span>go in a certain direction and remain at a little distance,
  hopping from one tree to another. On being followed it goes further; and so it will guide the way
  to a nest of bees. When this is reached, it flies about, but no longer guides; and then some
  knowledge is needed to discover the nest, even when pointed out to within a few trees. I have
  known this bird, if the man after taking up the direction for a little then turns away, come back
  and offer to point out another nest in a different part. But if it do not know of two nests, it
  will remain behind. The difficulty is, that it will point to tame bees in a bark-hive as readily
  as to those in the forest. This is natural, as the bee is the same; the bark-hive, 'Musinga' as it
  is named, being simply fastened up in a tree and left for the bees to come to. The object the bird
  has in view is clearly the young bees. It will guide to nests having no honey, and seems equally
  delighted if the comb containing the grubs be torn out when it is seen pecking at it."</p>

  <p>Fam. XVII. <b>Rhamphastidae.</b>&ndash;The Toucans<a id="NtA_257"
  href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> are easily recognisable by their huge beak, only paralleled by
  that of the Hornbills, of which some authors have considered them the Neotropical representatives;
  but whereas in the latter this beak is usually surmounted by a casque of varying size, in the
  Toucans it is shaped much as usual, though abnormally developed. It does not seem to interfere
  with the bird's powers of flight or feeding, and indeed the structure of both mandibles is
  admirably calculated to combine bulk with strength and lightness; the external walls being so thin
  and elastic that they are said in some species to be compressible by the fingers, while the inner
  cavities are filled with a network of bony columns, to which the air has constant access.
  Moreover, the maxilla is so perfectly hinged to the skull that the utmost ease in mastication is
  secured, the serrated edges further aiding in the process. In <i>Aulacorhamphus</i> the mandibles
  are grooved, and <i>Andigena laminirostris</i> has a square basal plate on each side of the
  culmen. The metatarsi are stout and scutellated on both aspects, the toes are papillose below, the
  claws sharp and curved. The somewhat weak wings have ten primaries and twelve secondaries; the
  square, rounded, or graduated tail of ten rectrices is capable of free vertical motion, and is
  frequently jerked up over the back. The furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the
  tongue is long, thin and narrow, with feather-like margins towards the tip; the nostrils <span
  class="pagenum" id="page454"><span class="smaller">{454}</span></span>open backwards behind the
  bill-sheath in <i>Rhamphastus</i>, upwards or sideways near the hind part of the culmen in the
  other genera; the syrinx is tracheo-bronchial; the aftershaft is rudimentary or absent; and
  neither adults nor nestlings shew any down.</p>

  <p>The coloration of the long, loose plumage, and of the beak and naked orbits, is most brilliant
  and varied; the females are smaller and duller than the males, and quite unlike them in
  <i>Selenidera</i>; while the young resemble the former, but have softer and differently-tinted
  bills. The feet are grey or green. <i>Pteroglossus beauharnaisi</i> has the black shafts of the
  crown-feathers dilated and coalescent with the barbs, producing an appearance like curls of
  horn.</p>

  <p>Toucans, except just after moulting, are shy and restless; they are more or less gregarious,
  and small flocks gather to feed or bathe in the morning or evening; at noon they sit motionless on
  some lofty tree, but at other times may be seen jumping about the branches. At night they roost
  with the tail thrown forward upon the back, and the head turned to meet it. Their flight is easy,
  graceful, and direct, accompanied by occasional noisy flaps of the wing, the bill being carried
  horizontally; they rarely seek the ground, where they hop about obliquely in awkward fashion. All
  the species live chiefly on fruits, including seeds; but Azara's statement that they destroy small
  birds, and devour both eggs and young, is possibly quite correct, as in captivity they exhibit
  great excitement and delight when furnished with meat, mice, reptiles, and so forth,<a
  id="NtA_258" href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a> tearing the food to pieces and masticating it
  with their serrated mandibles. Should, however, the object be small, they throw back the head and
  swallow it at a gulp; while a curious habit has been observed of regurgitating the substances for
  further mastication. Caterpillars, ants, and the like are added to the diet in the breeding
  season. When feeding in company, Toucans, like Rooks, post a sentinel, whose harsh, chattering
  scream can be heard for at least a mile: they are especially noisy in the morning and evening, or
  in wet weather. The unmelodious cry seems to vary considerably in the different species; being
  described as a croak, a hoarse note, a clear yelp, or a jarring sound like that of a Mistletoe
  Thrush. Owls and diurnal Birds of prey are often surrounded by a noisy mob of Toucans, which jerk
  their tails as they follow. Two oval and somewhat glossy white eggs are deposited in hollow limbs
  of tall trees. These birds are frequently eaten by <span class="pagenum" id="page455"><span
  class="smaller">{455}</span></span>the colonists and natives, the latter using their plumage to
  decorate their bows or their persons, while the beaks make convenient powder-flasks. They are
  easily tamed, and become amusing pets. The various forms extend throughout the forests of Tropical
  America down to the mangrove swamps of the coast, some occurring at an altitude of from six
  thousand to ten thousand feet on the mountains; northwards <i>Rhamphastus carinatus</i>,
  <i>Pteroglossus torquatus</i>, <i>Aulacorhamphus prasinus</i>, and <i>A. wagleri</i> reach South
  Mexico; southwards, <i>Rhamphastus toco</i> ranges to Argentina; but westwards no species crosses
  the Andes south of the Gulf of Guayaquil. They are not represented in the Antilles, though
  <i>Rhamphastus vitellinus</i> extends to Trinidad. Dr. Sclater<a id="NtA_259"
  href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> recognises five genera, comprising fifty-nine species, the
  majority inhabiting Amazonia and Guiana.</p>

      &times; &#x2153;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The genus <i>Rhamphastus</i> contains fourteen members, with <span class="pagenum"
  id="page456"><span class="smaller">{456}</span></span>nearly the same range as that of the Family,
  including the type and sole Argentine species <i>R. toco</i>, one of the largest forms, two feet
  in length. This is black, with white rump, throat and fore-neck (the last bordered with red),
  crimson vent, blue orbits, and orange bill terminally blotched with black, which has been likened
  to a lobster's claw. Several species have the throat and rump yellow or orange, or the latter
  scarlet, as in <i>R. ariel</i>. The brilliant bill and orbits vary considerably in colour; the
  tail is square. <i>Andigena</i> comprises some five forms from the highest forests of Colombia,
  Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, olive-brown or dark green above, and with hair-like bluish-grey
  plumage below; the crown is black, the nape black or grey, the vent scarlet, the rump yellow, and
  the tip of the graduated tail chestnut, except in one instance. The bill shews black, yellow, or
  red, in varied combination, <i>A. laminirostris</i> having a square ivory-white basal plate on
  each side of the maxilla. <i>A. bailloni</i>, of South-East Brazil, doubtfully placed in this
  genus, has a scarlet rump, yellow under parts, greenish and reddish bill, and red orbits.
  <i>Pteroglossus</i>, the most brilliant genus in the Family, exhibits green, scarlet, and yellow
  hues, with areas or bands of black and scarlet on the lower surface in thirteen out of eighteen
  species. The tail is graduated, and the feathers below are somewhat hair-like. These Ara&ccedil;ar&iacute;s, as
  they are called, range from South Mexico to Bolivia and South Brazil. The lovely <i>P.
  beauharnaisi</i>, of Upper Amazonia, has dark green upper parts, with crimson on the rump and
  mantle; and light yellow lower parts, tinged with red, which shew a scarlet ventral band and black
  spots on the throat; the maxilla is black with orange culmen, the mandible white. <i>P.
  aracari</i> of Guiana and Lower Amazonia has no red on the mantle, the smooth head and throat are
  black, the maxilla is white with black culmen, the mandible black. Some six species of
  <i>Selenidera</i>, remarkable for the dissimilar sexes, and generally for the transversely striped
  or blotched beak, range from South-East Brazil and Upper Amazonia to Nicaragua. The males, except
  in <i>S. spectabilis</i>, have a distinct nuchal crescent of yellow, less marked in the females;
  the former have the head and breast black, the latter usually chestnut; but the hen of the above
  species has the under surface black, that of <i>S. piperivora</i> greyish-green. The general
  colour is dark green, with brown tip to the tail, yellow or orange ear-coverts, and scarlet vent;
  the beak is whitish, reddish, or greenish, with black markings. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page457"><span class="smaller">{457}</span></span><i>Aulacorhamphus</i> has some dozen fairly
  uniform green members, relieved by a white, bluish, or black throat. The rump may be crimson or
  rufous, the rectrices tipped with chestnut, and the bill a mixture of red, black, yellow, or
  horn-colour, usually with a white line at the base. The range is from Mexico to Guiana and
  Bolivia.</p>

  <p>Fam. XVIII. <b>Picidae.</b>&ndash;The Woodpeckers form a very large Family of scansorial birds
  with zygodactylous feet, which is so natural that Huxley raised it to higher rank as
  <i>Celeomorphae</i>, while Parker separated it still further as <i>Saurognathae</i>. The two
  Sub-families are (1) <i>Picinae</i>, or Woodpeckers, and (2) <i>Iynginae</i>, or Wrynecks.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Picinae.</i>&ndash;The chief external peculiarities of this section lie in the
  form of the large head, the neck, and the tail-feathers. The neck is often much compressed, with
  exceedingly powerful muscles, which, coupled with the strong, wedge-shaped bill, enable the bird
  to operate with ease and celerity upon the boles and limbs of trees, whence it procures much of
  its food, and where it excavates a deep hole for the reception of its eggs. The shafts of the
  twelve tail-feathers, of which the outer pair are very small, are in the majority of cases stiff
  and spiny, and therefore well adapted to keep the body close to the bark while climbing; parallel
  cases being those of the Tree-Creeper (<i>Certhia</i>) and the Dendrocolaptinae. The shape of the
  tail is rounded or cuneate; the wings are moderate and not very much pointed, with ten primaries
  and from ten to thirteen secondaries. The metatarsus is short, with a single row of anterior
  scutes; the claws are large, sharp, and curved.<a id="NtA_260"
  href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The tongue is excessively long and "worm-like," with horny, barbed tip, and is capable of
  marvellous protrusion owing to the elongated "horns" of the hyoid apparatus, which in some forms
  curve round the skull and have their origin near the base of the bill. Facility is thus secured
  for searching narrow cracks or deep hollows for insects, while the secretion from the large
  salivary glands secures the adhesion of the objects aimed at. The furcula is <span class="sans
  fwb">U</span>-shaped, the syrinx tracheo-bronchial, the after-shaft rudimentary, while neither
  adults nor young have down at any stage.</p>

  <p>The prevailing colours are green, yellow, black, and white, in various combinations, with spots
  and bars; brilliant scarlet being commonly present on the crown and frequently also on the back
  <span class="pagenum" id="page458"><span class="smaller">{458}</span></span>or under parts. From
  the males the females and young in first plumage may be distinguished by their duller coloration;
  but in the intermediate stages of growth the latter exhibit a considerable amount of red. Many
  species have fine crests.</p>

  <p>According to Hargitt<a id="NtA_261" href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> the number of genera is
  fifty, including three hundred and eighty-five fairly defined species; though both genera and
  species depend chiefly on colour. He mentions <i>Colaptes</i> as an instance of the possible
  formation of races by hybridization or climatic influences, and <i>Gecinus</i> as an example of
  diversely coloured forms, perhaps originating from a common ancestor. The well-known colour-phases
  of <i>Dendrocopus major</i> and of the genus <i>Iyngipicus</i> may be mentioned in this connexion;
  the species becoming larger and whiter as they range eastwards through Central Asia to Japan, and
  the former also shewing a tendency to a crimson tint on the breast as it nears Africa
  southwards.</p>

  <p>Woodpeckers are, with a few exceptions, solitary woodland birds of a particularly shy and
  retiring nature, and therefore somewhat difficult of observation. When seeking food they usually
  ascend a tree in spiral fashion assisted by their tail and claws, and carefully examine every
  chink or cranny in the bark; on reaching the higher limbs they betake themselves at once to fresh
  hunting-grounds, often alighting at the very base of a trunk, but equally often flying straight to
  some promising half-decayed branch. In some cases, however, high flights are essayed. The species
  of <i>Colaptes</i> and <i>Geocolaptes</i> feed upon the ground; many forms, such as <i>Picus
  martius</i>, <i>Gecinus viridis</i>, and <i>Melanerpes formicivorus</i>, prey largely upon ants
  and take great pains to make a thorough clearance of the nest; the last-named stores up acorns;
  while <i>Sphyrapicus varius</i> and its congeners suck the sap of trees and also hawk for flies:
  others again devour a large quantity of fruits, seeds, and perhaps even Indian corn. Omitting,
  however, the sap-sucking propensities of the American species, the harm done is outweighed by the
  good.</p>

  <p>In spring the laughing, ringing, or other cries may be heard in most wooded districts; the
  sounds being somewhat harsh, and consisting of more or less continuous notes according to the
  species, while the duration is commonly about thirty seconds. The curious "drumming" noise
  produced in particular by the Spotted and Black Woodpeckers is also chiefly heard early in the
  year, though it ceases not with the courting, but when the young <span class="pagenum"
  id="page459"><span class="smaller">{459}</span></span>are hatched. This sound, which can be heard
  for a mile, is caused by the bill hammering on the bark&ndash;usually of some rotten branch, while
  the bird's head moves backwards and forwards with extraordinary rapidity; a stationary position,
  however, is not invariably preserved, nor the quest of food interrupted. The hen sometimes hisses
  loudly if disturbed upon her eggs; both parents are said to "purr" in certain American species
  when the hole is interfered with, and they certainly utter continuous, sharp alarm-notes in
  Britain. It is probable, but perhaps hardly certain, that the female drums as well as the male.
  The sense of hearing is extremely acute in the Family. The flight is strong and undulating with
  constant "dips," and when once witnessed can be recognised at considerable distances. Both sexes
  help to excavate the hole for their eggs, which is a neat circular aperture, worked from the
  centre outwards, and carried inwards to the core of the wood, to descend thence for at least a
  foot; as soon as it turns downwards it gradually enlarges, until the whole presents the form of a
  long-necked bottle. Abortive borings are often made, of considerable depth; while the chips may be
  found lying at the foot of the tree in a heap, if not removed by the birds, as occasionally
  happens. Firs, oaks, poplars, beeches, ashes, and willows, both high and low, furnish many
  breeding places, but wooden walls or towers are also utilized, and two species, mentioned below,
  bore like Kingfishers in banks. The same hole is occasionally tenanted in successive years, but
  natural cavities are rarely used. It is commonly stated that Woodpeckers always choose for their
  excavations decayed or decaying limbs; but the soundest branches, or even the thickest parts of
  the trunks of huge oaks, are not unfrequently selected. The oval, glossy, white eggs are deposited
  on a few chips, and usually number from three or five to ten; nevertheless as many as
  seventy-three are recorded as the produce of one Woodpecker, and forty-two in the case of the
  Wryneck, when robbed on successive days.<a id="NtA_262" href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a> Both
  sexes are known to incubate in certain cases: they sit very closely towards the end of the period,
  which lasts fourteen days or more, yet often leave their hole quite readily at first. Many species
  have been tamed, but they are wild and destructive in captivity.</p>

  <p>The Family ranges over the greater portion of the globe, except the Australian Region,
  Madagascar, and Egypt. Its members are <span class="pagenum" id="page460"><span
  class="smaller">{460}</span></span>most abundant in the Indian and Neotropical Regions, several
  forms occurring in the Antilles.</p>

  <p><i>Geocolaptes olivaceus</i>, an olive-coloured bird with whitish marks on the wings and tail,
  crimson rump, and crimson-washed abdomen, is common in the Cape Colony and Natal, and is
  remarkable for nesting in holes in banks or mud-huts: it feeds upon the ground, and family-parties
  are stated by Mr. Layard to keep together until the following breeding-season. Similar habits have
  been observed in <i>Colaptes agricola</i> of the Argentine Republic and Patagonia, in timberless
  districts; but, as the trees grow, it recurs to its natural habits. <i>C. auratus</i>, the
  golden-winged Flicker of North America, has a phase (<i>C. mexicanus</i>) found west of the Rocky
  Mountains and in Mexico, with red coloration of the wings in place of yellow, intermediate races
  occurring in the intervening regions; considerable controversy has consequently arisen as to
  whether hybridization has taken place, or whether this is a case of specialized forms of a
  generalized ancestor, due to climatic or other causes. The colour above is dove-brown with black
  streaks; the head being lead-coloured with a crimson band on the nape, the rump white, the lower
  throat black, the under parts pinkish-brown with round black spots, and the wings strongly washed
  with yellow on both surfaces. The bill is more arched and less wedge-shaped than usual. The food
  consists of fruit, wood-lice, ants, and so forth, much of which is procured upon the earth.</p>

  <p><i>Gecinus viridis</i>, our well-known Green Woodpecker, Yaffle, or Rain-bird, the "laugh" of
  which is supposed to predict wet weather, is a green bird with yellow rump and red head; the
  habits being those common to the whole group, though a certain preference is shewn for feeding on
  the ground or on ant-hills. It ranges throughout Europe to Asia Minor and Persia, while other
  nearly allied forms, differing in their black occiputs or scarlet rumps, extend over nearly the
  whole Eastern Palaearctic and Indian Regions. <i>Chloronerpes</i> is a Central and South American
  genus of smaller birds, among which <i>C. rubiginosus</i> has golden-rufous upper parts, with a
  red nape, and yellowish under surface crossed by dark bars. Akin to this is the Ethiopian
  <i>Campethera</i>, <i>C. punctata</i> being yellow, olive, and brown above, with a crimson head,
  and yellow below with small black spots. <i>Chrysophlegma</i> extends from the Himalayas to China
  and the Malay Islands. <i>C. flavinucha</i> is about the size of the Green Woodpecker, but <span
  class="pagenum" id="page461"><span class="smaller">{461}</span></span>is much yellower, and has a
  splendid orange crest on the nape, a yellow throat and a grey breast; <i>C. miniatum</i> has the
  crest and upper parts washed with red.</p>

  <p>The three-toed <i>Gauropico&iuml;des rafflesi</i> of the Malay countries has a long black crest, and
  narrow, pointed tail-feathers, which contrast well with its golden back; the under parts are
  brownish. <i>Asyndesmus torquatus</i> of the Western United States has very peculiar hair-like
  plumage below, in which the first subdivisions of the whitish webs are not again divided; the
  upper surface is bronzy-green, the front of the head crimson, and the collar white.
  <i>Melanerpes</i> is a large genus with many brilliant forms, which range throughout America;
  <i>M. flavifrons</i> being black above, with white rump, crimson head and breast, broad golden
  forehead and throat, and brownish chest; <i>M. candidus</i> having the head and breast pure white,
  and the blackish back only relieved by a yellow band on the nape; whereas <i>M. formicivorus</i>
  is intermediate in coloration. The last-named, often called the Californian Woodpecker, extends
  southwards to Mexico and northwards up the Pacific Coast to British Columbia; it stores up acorns
  by inserting their upper halves in holes bored in the limbs of trees, which may be sometimes seen
  studded with them to a height of forty feet or more.<a id="NtA_263"
  href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> Apparently this is done for the sake of the grubs in the
  acorns; while, as its name implies, the bird also devours ants.</p>

  <p><i>Sphyropicus</i> contains the three Sap-suckers, which together range throughout North
  America, an individual having strayed to Greenland. <i>S. varius</i> shews a striking combination
  of colours in its black and white back, crimson head and throat, black chest, and yellow breast,
  while it has the curious habit, shared by its congeners, of puncturing trunks of trees to obtain
  the sap, in which they delight. Sometimes the entire bole is encircled by these borings.</p>

  <p>Nearly all that has already been said of the Family in general, particularly with regard to the
  "drumming," may be repeated of the Spotted Woodpeckers, of which <i>Dendrocopus major</i> and
  <i>D. minor</i> are the British representatives. The colours in this genus are black and white in
  varied proportions, with crimson on the head and often on the lower parts; a small amount of buff
  and brown being not uncommonly added, while in <i>D. brunneifrons</i>, a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page462"><span class="smaller">{462}</span></span>Himalayan form, there is an admixture of
  yellow with the red on the crown. Our Greater and Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers extend throughout
  Europe and North Asia, and reach the Atlantic Islands; while some thirty congeners widen the range
  until it includes nearly all the Palaeartic, Nearctic, and Indian Regions. They are also found
  south of lat. 20&deg; S. in the Neotropical. <i>D. leuconotus</i> and <i>D.</i> (<i>Dendrocoptes</i>)
  <i>medius</i> are other European forms, with varying races. <i>Pico&iuml;des</i> is a similarly
  coloured genus of three-toed birds, with yellow instead of red on the head. They inhabit the most
  northern forests of both Worlds, reaching southward to Central Europe, China, and (west of the
  Rocky Mountains) to New Mexico. <i>P. tridactylus</i> is well-known in Europe.</p>

  <p><i>Iyngipicus</i> is a large group of small species, which stretch from India to the Kuril
  Islands, Chira, Flores, and Celebes; and, if Hargitt is right in considering <i>Picus
  obsoletus</i> congeneric, from North-East Africa to Senegambia. The colours are black or olive
  above, relieved by white and fulvescent below with dark stripes or spots, the occiput shewing a
  band, or two streaks, of red; the lateral tail-feathers, moreover, are hardly rigid, approaching
  in that respect those of <i>Picumnus</i>. <i>Dendrobates</i> is a still larger genus of similarly
  sized birds, varying from nearly uniform olive with a red crown, or bright red with white under
  parts, to dull gold-colour, where the lower surface is buff barred with brown; the head being in
  the last case red, but the nape yellow. They range from Northern Argentina to Central America.
  <i>Mesopicus goertan</i>, one of half a dozen finely-coloured species found throughout most of the
  Ethiopian Region, has an olive back, long crimson feathers on the head and rump, and a greyish
  breast.</p>

  <p>Thus far all the members of the Family agree in having the nostrils covered with bristles.
  Among those in which the bristles are wanting may be mentioned <i>Celeus</i> and the three-toed
  <i>Tiga javanensis</i> and its congeners, extending from India to Cochin China. The last-named has
  a brilliant golden-orange back, a crimson <span class="pagenum" id="page463"><span
  class="smaller">{463}</span></span>head, crest and rump, black tail, neck and wings, and dark
  brown under parts with white spots. <i>Celeus</i> ranges from Mexico to South Brazil, <i>C.
  flavus</i> being canary-yellow with brown tail and wings, a large crest of the former colour, and
  a crimson stripe at the gape. This genus, and the five following, are characterized by having the
  neck extremely narrow and compressed.</p>

  <p><i>Campephilus</i>, ranging from the Gulf States and the Lower Mississippi to Argentina, and
  <i>Ipocrantor</i>, of Chili and Patagonia, are noticeable for the concave ends of their
  tail-feathers. <i>C. principalis</i>, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker of the Southern United
  States&ndash;almost the largest member of the Family&ndash;frequents the highest timber, where,
  according to Wilson, it used to strip off cart-loads of bark, and make huge quantities of chips.
  It appears, however, that it only attacked trees infested by insect-larvae. When it was common the
  Indians used the head as a charm, and considered that it gave them the creature's courage. Its
  main colour is bluish-black with white wing-markings; the crimson and black occipital feathers
  together forming a long crest. Both this bird and the Pileated Woodpecker of North America
  (<i>Dryotomus pileatus</i>) are locally known as "Log-cocks," with which name may be compared that
  of "Stock-eagle," <i>i.e.</i> "Stump-eagle," given in the West of England to the Greater Spotted
  Woodpecker. <span class="pagenum" id="page464"><span
  class="smaller">{464}</span></span><i>Ipocrantor magellanicus</i>, of Chili and Patagonia, has an
  even longer crest. <i>Hemicercus</i> is a genus of curious little crested black and white species,
  with very short and hardly rigid tails, occurring in India, the Malay countries, and Cochin China.
  <i>Hemilophus pulverulentus</i>, a larger bird of similar range, is remarkable for its enormous
  bill and curious dusty-looking slaty plumage.</p>

  <p>Under the head of <i>Picus</i>, which gives the Family its name, is placed by Hargitt only
  <i>P. martius</i>, the Black Woodpecker, an inhabitant of the pine-forests of Europe and Asia to
  Japan, quite erroneously asserted to have occurred in England. The colour is black with the
  exception of a red head, while the feathering extends down two-thirds of the metatarsus in front.
  It feeds chiefly on ants, insects, and their larvae, utters a loud rattling cry, drums on trees,
  and lays four or five eggs in holes bored in rotten wood.</p>

  <p>The Piculets are considered by most writers to form a Sub-family <i>Picumninae</i>, and connect
  the <i>Picinae</i> and the <i>Iynginae</i>, being the least specialized of the former; they
  constitute the genus <i>Picumnus</i>, of which the thirty or more members have short, rounded
  tails without spiny shafts, and nostrils hidden by bristles. These diminutive birds occupy America
  from Honduras to Northern Argentina, as well as most of the Indian Region, one being a native of
  Africa; they are duller than most Woodpeckers, and are rufous, olive, or greyish, while often
  marked with black, or with red or yellow on the head. <i>P. micromegas</i> is confined to
  Hispaniola, <i>P.</i> (<i>Verreauxia</i>) <i>africanus</i> to the Gaboon districts, <i>P.</i>
  (<i>Sasia</i>) <i>ochraceus</i> and its two congeners are found in Northern India and the Malay
  countries. Of these only the first has any bright colour on the head. <i>Sasia</i> lacks the
  hallux.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Iynginae.</i>&ndash;The Wrynecks may be distinguished from the typical
  Woodpeckers by their soft tails without spiny shafts, and naked nostrils with a partial covering.
  The plumage shews a peculiar mixture of black, brown, grey, and white, somewhat similar to that of
  a Nightjar. They feed chiefly upon the ground on ants and the like, and do not seek for insects
  under the bark of trees to the same extent that Woodpeckers do; while, instead of cutting out
  their own nesting-hole, they utilize cavities in stumps, posts, or even banks, to contain the
  white eggs, from five to ten in number, and often choose the same site annually. These birds have
  a curious habit of erecting the head-feathers and twisting the head itself from side to side, or
  almost over the back, either when sitting quietly on a branch or when molested. They <span
  class="pagenum" id="page465"><span class="smaller">{465}</span></span>utter a loud, triple note,
  frequently reiterated, which has been compared to that of the Kestrel, and somewhat resembles the
  spring cry of the Nuthatch. Owing to the non-spinous tail the members of this genus cannot climb
  so well as Woodpeckers, while on the ground they are awkward and move with constant hops. The
  extensile and worm-like tongue is not barbed at the tip. <i>Iynx torquilla</i>, the Cuckoo's-mate
  or Snake-bird, is fairly common in England, and extends thence to Japan, Kordofan, and Senegal.
  The remaining species are all Ethiopian, <i>I. pectoralis</i> with a reddish-brown fore-neck and
  chest inhabiting the southern half of Africa, the similar <i>I. pulchricollis</i> occurring in
  East Equatorial Africa, and <i>I. aequatorialis</i>, in which the red extends to the whole breast,
  being met with only in Abyssinia.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order XIV. PASSERIFORMES.</b></p>

  <p>This Order contains about five thousand five hundred species, being more than half the birds
  yet known. Their classification is attended with much difficulty, and the anatomy of many more
  forms must be investigated before anything approaching a satisfactory&ndash;not to say
  final&ndash;scheme can be proposed. The earlier taxonomers often based their systems largely on
  European genera, and were therefore obliged to interpose others, or even to recognise new
  Families, as their knowledge extended, among the many new discoveries, to various American and
  Australian forms.</p>

  <p>The foundation of recent arrangements of the group, depending on the number or position of the
  song-muscles, was laid between 1845 and 1847 by Johannes M&uuml;ller, who divided the then generally
  accepted Order <i>Insessores</i> into three tribes: (1) <i>Oscines</i> or <i>Polymyodi</i>
  [Song-birds, or those with many (usually five or seven) pairs of song-muscles]; (2)
  <i>Tracheophones</i> [where the bronchi take no part in the formation of the voice-organ]; and (3)
  <i>Picarii</i> [corresponding in the main to Nitzsch's <i>Picariae</i>]; the two former of which
  included most of the Passerine forms. Simultaneously with M&uuml;ller, Cabanis proposed a system
  grounded on similar principles; while in 1867 Huxley recognised of his group <i>Coracomorphae</i>
  the divisions <i>Polymyodae</i>, <i>Tracheophonae</i>, and <i>Oligomyodae</i> [birds with few
  song-muscles]. About ten years later Garrod, who was followed between 1880 and 1882 by W. A.
  Forbes, divided the Passeres into <i>Desmodactyli</i>, with a band joining the muscles of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page467"><span class="smaller">{467}</span></span>hallux to the front
  toes, and <i>Eleutherodactyli</i>, where the hind toe is free. The former contained only the
  <i>Eurylaemidae</i>; the latter the <i>Mesomyodi</i> (where the syringeal muscles join the
  bronchial semi-rings in their middle or lateral portion), and the <i>Acromyodi</i> (where they are
  attached to the extremities). The subdivisions need not be discussed here; but it should be
  noticed that, as opposed to M&uuml;ller, the attachment, and not the number, of muscles was the point
  relied upon. Want of space forbids an account of the subsequent labours of Mr. Sclater,<a
  id="NtA_264" href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> Professors Newton<a id="NtA_265"
  href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> and F&uuml;rbringer,<a id="NtA_266"
  href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a> and others; but the last-named no doubt influenced
  considerably the views of Dr. Gadow, mainly accepted below. This author<a id="NtA_267"
  href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> takes into consideration not only the attachment, but also the
  disposition of the muscles of the syrinx, and distinguishes his <i>Passeriformes</i> as (1)
  <i>Passeres anisomyodae</i>, where the syringeal muscles are unequally inserted, either in the
  middle, or upon the dorsal or ventral end only, of the bronchial semi-rings; (2) <i>Passeres
  diacromyodae</i>, where some of the muscles are attached to the dorsal, and some to the ventral
  ends. The former of these groups may be subdivided into A. <i>Subclamatores</i> and B.
  <i>Clamatores</i>; the latter into C. <i>Suboscines</i> and D. <i>Oscines</i>. Even the groups (1)
  and (2) are expressly stated not to rise to the rank of Sub-Orders, while the <i>Oscines</i> and
  other equivalent divisions are of hardly more than Family value.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The great number of species in the Order <i>Passeriformes</i> makes it necessary to
  treat the various sections less fully than has been the case in the foregoing portion of the work,
  while the Families are not, of course, on the same level here as elsewhere.</p>

  <p class="ac">A. <i>Subclamatores.</i></p>

  <p>Fam. <b>Eurylaemidae.</b>&ndash;The Broad-bills, a curious Old World group, have been by
  various authors regarded as allied to the Rollers or to the Flycatchers. They are distinguished
  from all other Passerine forms by the fact that the hallux is connected with the front toes by a
  vinculum or band joining the deep plantar tendons, and is thus incapable of independent motion.
  The beak is very <span class="pagenum" id="page468"><span
  class="smaller">{468}</span></span>broad, while it is comparatively small in <i>Calyptomena</i>;
  <i>Corydon</i>, and to a less extent <i>Eurylaemus</i> and <i>Sarcophanops</i>, have a decided
  terminal hook to the maxilla. The metatarsus is scutellated in front and smooth behind
  (laminiplantar); the hallux is weak; the third and fourth toes are distinctly united, the claws
  are very short. The moderate wings have ten primaries in <i>Calyptomena</i>, eleven elsewhere,
  <i>Eurylaemus</i> having the eleventh very small; the secondaries are nine or ten; the tail of
  twelve rectrices is usually long and rounded, but is graduated in <i>Psarisomus</i>, short and
  square in <i>Calyptomena</i>. The adults have no aftershaft or down, the tongue is sagittate, and
  <i>Sarcophanops</i> has naked orbits. The plumage in <i>Calyptomena viridis</i> of the Indo-Malay
  countries is bright green, with a large black post-auricular and a yellow pre-ocular spot, three
  black bars on the wing-coverts, and blackish wing- and tail-quills. The duller female has no black
  spots or bars. The dense frontal feathers project forward over the beak. <i>C. whiteheadi</i> of
  Borneo has a black throat. These somewhat inactive birds inhabit thin jungles, utter soft
  whistles, and feed on fruit; the rest of the Family eat little but insects, though
  <i>Cymborhynchus macrorhynchus</i>, the Rain-bird of the Malays, enjoys berries.</p>

  <p><i>Eurylaemus javanicus</i> is blackish, with yellow markings on the back, tail, and wings; the
  head, neck, and under parts being vinous purple, with a black crescentic chest-band, which is
  absent in the hen. <i>Corydon sumatranus</i> is black, with a white alar bar and a buffish-white
  throat and fore-neck. They cover much the same area as <i>Calyptomena</i>. <i>Cymborhynchus</i>
  shews black and crimson colours, while the beautiful <i>Psarisomus dalhousiae</i>, found from the
  Eastern Himalayas to Borneo, has a green back and under <span class="pagenum" id="page469"><span
  class="smaller">{469}</span></span>surface, black and blue head and wings, yellow face and throat,
  and blue tail becoming black below. <i>Serilophus</i> contains two grey-brown species with
  chestnut rumps, ranging from Sikkim to Tenasserim. <i>Sarcophanops</i> is peculiar to the
  Philippines.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The quiet and solitary Broad-bills inhabit forests, thickets, and gardens, flying
  little, sitting sluggishly on the branches, taking insects on the wing, and uttering whistling or
  metallic notes. They make large roughish oval nests, with a large entrance near the top often
  protected by an overhanging roof, while a sort of tail is commonly added; these are suspended from
  low branches or plants close to water; the materials being twigs, roots, tendrils, moss, or
  leaves, felted together and smoothly lined with green foliage, flags, bamboo-spathes, or grass,
  sometimes renewed when dry. From three to five eggs are laid, pale yellowish in
  <i>Calyptomena</i>, white or rarely spotted with red in <i>Psarisomus</i>, and pinkish, buff or
  white elsewhere, with markings varying from black to rufous.</p>

  <p class="ac">B. <i>Clamatores.</i></p>

  <p>This group includes the <i>Pittidae</i>, <i>Philepittidae</i>, <i>Xenicidae</i>,
  <i>Tyrannidae</i>, <i>Oxyrhamphidae</i>, <i>Pipridae</i>, <i>Cotingidae</i>, <i>Phytotomidae</i>,
  <i>Dendrocolaptidae</i>, <i>Formicariidae</i>, <i>Conopophagidae</i>, and
  <i>Pteroptochidae</i>.</p>

  <p>Apparently the furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the tongue varies; the
  aftershaft is small, if present; the down is sparing or absent.</p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Pittidae.</b>&ndash;The members of this Old World Family, nearly fifty in number,
  range from India to North China, East Australia, New Guinea, and New Britain; while one species is
  West African. They are stout, strong-billed forms, with short rounded wings and tail, the long
  metatarsus being more or less scutellated all round; the primaries number ten&ndash;the outer
  being decidedly long&ndash;the secondaries eight, the rectrices twelve. The plumage exhibits vivid
  scarlet, blue, and green tints, in addition to yellow, purple, black, brown, and white; elongated
  neck-feathers occur in <i>Anthocincla</i>, erect frontal plumes in <i>Coracopitta</i>. The tail in
  <i>Pitta</i> is nearly square, but is pointed in <i>Eucichla</i>, and <i>Coracopitta</i>. The
  habits seem to be fairly uniform, all the species haunting thickish jungle or dense scrub, whether
  in the rock-strewn glens of India, or the damp Malayan, Australian, and Papuasian forests. The
  birds are more often heard than seen, though the plaintive, oft-repeated double whistle of the
  smaller forms, or the mournful, triple cry of the larger, is seldom audible in the mid-day heat,
  both being recognisable by the long-drawn final syllable.</p>

  <p>They are chiefly terrestrial, and jump from rock to rock or branch to stump with great agility;
  their apparently leisurely movements being really so quick that a mere glimpse is usually obtained
  through some opening in the foliage, while their habits are consequently difficult to observe. The
  quiet watcher may, however, hear the birds pattering over the beds of leaves, and see them hunting
  for molluscs and insects, or digging for worms and ants, but the slightest movement causes them to
  depart with long rapid hops, exchanged under pressure for a low, direct noiseless flight of short
  duration. Pittas are habitually, though not invariably, solitary, and are especially shy when
  breeding. <i>P. moluccensis</i> ascends the trees to call, <i>P. oatesi</i> occasionally whistles
  at night, while <i>P. novae guineae</i> flirts its tail like a Wagtail. The exposed nest, with its
  lateral entrance, is frequently placed on the ground at the foot of a tree or shrub, but sometimes
  amongst undergrowth or in very low forks; it is a rounded fabric of twigs, roots, bark, moss,
  leaves, and grass, often cemented with earth; the larger species making a clumsier and looser
  structure, the smaller a more compact mass. Unspotted eggs are rare, the usual colour being
  creamy-white with brown, reddish, grey, or purplish-black spots or scrawls; the number is from
  three to six. <i>Anthocincla phayrii</i> and <i>Pitta cucullata</i> are said occasionally to build
  a platform of sticks before their doorway, and the latter a projecting roof over it. The former
  species, which inhabits Burma, is brown with a black coronal streak, black and white superciliary
  stripes, white throat, and pink vent; <i>Pitta caerulea</i> is bright blue above, with black
  occiput and nape, but an otherwise ashy head; it is greyish-buff below, with a partial black
  collar. The female <span class="pagenum" id="page471"><span class="smaller">{471}</span></span>has
  a brown back, and a buffish head, with black cross-bars and collar. This very large form ranges
  from Tenasserim to Sumatra and Borneo; the smaller <i>P. cyanea</i> of Bhutan, Burma, and Siam is
  somewhat similar, but has a scarlet nape, and bluish under parts with black bars. <i>P. maxima</i>
  of Gilolo is glossy black, with blue wing-coverts, a white alar bar, green edges to the
  secondaries, white lower surface, black chin, and crimson belly. <i>P. granatina</i> of Borneo is
  purplish-black, with scarlet occiput and nape, blue superciliary stripe, some blue on the wing,
  purplish throat, and scarlet belly. <i>P. baudi</i> of the same island is crimson above, with blue
  crown and tail, black nape, and white alar bar; the lower parts being black, with purple and blue
  abdomen: the female is dull brown below. <i>P. cyanoptera</i>, reaching from Burma and Borneo to
  South China, is dull green above, with a dark central stripe and a black margin to the brownish
  crown; the black wing shews a white bar, and azure on the coverts; the tip of the black tail and
  the rump are blue; the lower surface is buff, with crimson on the belly. Several species have
  green under parts, a blue pectoral band, or no blue on the rump and wings. <i>P. angolensis</i>
  inhabits West Africa, <i>P. nympha</i> North China and Tsu-shima Island, <i>P. iris</i> and <i>P.
  strepitans</i> Australia; the latter reaches New Guinea, where it meets, among other forms, the
  entirely black <i>Coracopitta lugubris</i>, as well as <i>P. mackloti</i>, which extends to New
  Britain.</p>

  streaks on that part. The outward form and habits recall those of <i>Pitta</i>, but the latter are
  more arboreal. The young are apparently spotted, unlike those of the Pittidae, which resemble the
  adults.</p>

  <p>Fam. III. <b>Xenicidae.</b>&ndash;This contains the genera <i>Acanthidositta</i> and
  <i>Traversia</i>, each with one species, and <i>Xenicus</i> with two; they are remarkable New
  Zealand forms, in which the weak syringeal muscles only reach the lowest tracheal ring. The
  slender metatarsi are almost smooth, the claws acute and elongated; the short rectrices number
  ten, and the tenth primary is nearly equal to the next; the secondaries are eight. The tongue is
  lanceolate and horny. The stout-billed, long-legged <i>Xenicus longipes</i> has dark green upper
  parts, a brown crown, a yellowish rump and sides, black cheeks, whitish superciliary stripes and
  throat, and silky, bluish-grey under parts. The female is chiefly brown. <i>X. gilviventris</i> is
  olive-brown on the back and cheeks, and purplish-brown beneath, with some rufous and a black spot
  on the wing. Both forms inhabit the South Island, and are called "Bush-Wren" and Rock-Wren
  respectively. The former frequents dark sub-alpine forests, restlessly searching the trees for
  insects, their chrysalids and larvae, and uttering a weak note or a trill. It is seldom seen on
  the ground, yet flies but little, as might be expected from its short, rounded wings. The compact
  domed nest of moss, placed in low forks or in tree-roots, contains five or six white eggs with
  pink blotches; when built in holes it is open. The other species lives among d&eacute;bris high up the
  hills, being almost entirely terrestrial, skulking round the boulders, and eating dragonflies,
  lepidoptera, and insects generally, with scraps of fat from any traveller's camp. The nest of
  roots, twigs, and leaves, lined with feathers, is placed in crevices, and contains some five white
  eggs. The similar <i>Traversia lyalli</i> of Stephens Island is said to be nocturnal.
  <i>Acanthidositta chloris</i>, the Rifleman, is dull green above with yellower rump, and fulvous
  white below; the moderate wings are blackish, with green edgings and yellow bars; the eye-stripe
  is white; the short rounded tail is black with light tip. The female has an olive upper surface
  with brown markings, a yellow rump, and buffish under parts. This species inhabits the
  hill-forests of both the main islands of New Zealand, where it actively searches the trees for
  food with quivering wings, and utters a feeble "cheep." The more or less bottle-shaped nest,
  placed in holes in trees, <span class="pagenum" id="page473"><span
  class="smaller">{473}</span></span>buildings, and so forth, is formed of bents, roots, and
  feathers, and contains from three to five white eggs.</p>

  <p>Fam. IV. <b>Tyrannidae.</b>&ndash;This comprises some four hundred species, chiefly of an olive
  or black-and-grey coloration, which is occasionally relieved by bright scarlet as in
  <i>Pyrocephalus</i>, orange-red as in <i>Muscivora</i>, or yellow as in <i>Todirostrum</i>; but
  these hues are not necessarily common to whole genera. <i>Agriornis</i> and <i>Megarhynchus</i>
  are exceptionally large forms, but the majority are small, and in habits and appearance resemble
  the Old World Flycatchers, or even Shrikes. From the former, however, they are easily
  distinguished by their normal outer primary and the exteriorly scutellated back of the metatarsus
  (exaspidean). Dr. Sclater<a id="NtA_268" href="#Nt_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> recognises four
  Sub-families, <i>Taeniopterinae</i>, <i>Platyrhynchinae</i>, <i>Elaineinae</i>, and
  <i>Tyranninae</i>.</p>

  <p>The curved bill, varying in length and stoutness, is compressed and bristly at the gape in the
  Taeniopterinae, hardly bristly in the Elaineinae, depressed and decidedly bristly in the
  Platyrhynchinae and Tyranninae; while the culmen is most strongly hooked in the larger species,
  being much curved in <i>Oncostoma</i>, particularly broad and flat in <i>Platyrhynchus</i>,
  <i>Megarhynchus</i>, <i>Muscivora</i>, <i>Todirostrum</i>, and <i>Euscarthmus</i>, swollen and
  very wide in <i>Rhynchocyclus</i>. In the first and last of the Sub-families the metatarsus is
  strong and often long; in the remainder it is comparatively weak; <i>Centrites</i> has an
  extremely elongated hallux, correlated with Lark-like habits. The wing is usually short, but is
  often long in the Taeniopterinae and Tyranninae; the outer of the ten primaries are at times
  acuminate in <i>Tyrannus</i>, <i>Hapalocercus</i>, <i>Cnipolegus</i>, and <i>Taenioptera</i>,
  whereas in <i>Colopterus</i> and <i>Alectrurus</i> these quills are unusually reduced. The
  secondaries are nine. The tail, normally of twelve rectrices, varies much in length, and is very
  deeply forked and graduated in <i>Milvulus</i>, <i>Muscipipra</i>, and three members of
  <i>Tyrannus</i>, moderately divided in <i>Contopus</i> and certain species of <i>Taenioptera</i>,
  and so forth; it is not infrequently nearly square; while it is long and rounded in
  <i>Capsiempis</i> and the like; long and graduated, with only ten narrowly-barbed feathers in
  <i>Culicivora</i>; of the same shape in <i>Cybernetes</i>; and excessively reduced in <i>Orchilus
  ecaudatus</i>. <i>Copurus</i> possesses two very long median rectrices; the male of <i>Alectrurus
  tricolor</i> has the two fairly long outer feathers with their inner webs abnormally developed,
  and that of <i>A. risorius</i> has them enormously lengthened and broadened.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page474"><span class="smaller">{474}</span></span></div>

  <p>The Taeniopterinae, which are generally black, grey, and white, frequent the open parts of
  wooded districts, river-sides, or exceptionally marshes, in South America, a few of them extending
  north of Panama; the Elaineinae and Platyrhynchinae are olive, grey, brown, and yellow, and
  inhabit dense forests from South Mexico to Patagonia, <i>Ornithion imberbe</i> ranging as far
  north as Texas; the Tyranninae&ndash;with many large species&ndash;normally exhibit olive, grey,
  yellow, or white in varying proportions, and include most of the Nearctic genera, such as
  <i>Contopus</i>, <i>Empidonax</i>, <i>Myiarchus</i>, and <i>Tyrannus</i>, as well as many
  Neotropical forms, and the entirely Antillean <i>Blacicus</i> and <i>Lawrencia</i>. Erectile
  crests occur in some cases in <i>Tyrannulus</i>, <i>Cnipolegus</i>, <i>Colopterus</i>,
  <i>Pseudotriccus</i>, <i>Lophotriccus</i>, <i>Machetornis</i>, <i>Muscivora</i>, <i>Empidonax</i>,
  <i>Anaeretes</i>, <i>Elainea</i>, <i>Pyrocephalus</i>, <i>Myiobius</i>, and <i>Mitrephanes</i>;
  white eye-rings are found in <i>Euscarthmus zosterops</i>, <i>E. orbitatus</i>, and <i>Capsiempis
  orbitalis</i>; a fleshy yellow caruncle surrounds each eye in <i>Lichenops</i>; and in the
  breeding male of <i>Alectrurus risorius</i> the throat and cheeks shew bare orange skin.</p>

  <p>The following are examples of the coloration, which is often similar in both sexes. <i>Tyrannus
  pipiri</i>, the King-bird of temperate North America, ranging to Peru in winter, is dark grey,
  with a concealed orange patch on the black crown, black and white wings and tail, and white under
  parts. <i>Pyrocephalus rubineus</i>, of South America north of Buenos Aires, is dark cinereous
  with crimson head and lower surface, the female being grey above, and chiefly white below with
  grey stripes. <i>Muscivora regia</i> of Guiana and Amazonia is brown, with a scarlet crest tipped
  with purplish, and has ochraceous under parts with brownish bars. The crest is yellower in the
  hen. <i>Megarhynchus pitangua</i>, of Central and South America to Paraguay, is brown, with yellow
  lower surface, a black head, white superciliary streaks joining on the nape, a concealed orange
  coronal patch, and a white throat. <i>Elainea pagana</i>, ranging from South Mexico to Brazil, is
  dull olive above, and greyish-white below with yellow belly; a spot on the crown and two alar bars
  being white. <i>Cyanotis azarae</i> of La Plata, Chili, and West Peru has bronzy-green upper and
  yellow lower surface, with a partial black band beneath and a crimson vent; the head is black with
  a crimson spot, the wings and tail are black and white. <i>Todirostrum cinereum</i> of Central
  America and eastern South America is greyish above and yellow below, with black crown, wings, and
  tail, the primaries having yellow edges and <span class="pagenum" id="page475"><span
  class="smaller">{475}</span></span>the tail a white tip. <i>Taenioptera dominicana</i>, of
  South-East Brazil and Argentina, is white with the wings and tail mainly black; <i>Cnipolegus
  unicolor</i> of Upper Amazonia is uniform black.</p>

  <p>Tyrants are active and restless birds, chiefly met with near rivers or marshes, where they are
  constantly seen sitting alone on the branches of trees, bushes, dead thistles, and giant
  pampas-grasses, or more rarely, as in the Chat-like <i>Muscisaxicola</i>, on clods and boulders;
  thence they dart, like Flycatchers, upon their prey. <i>Centrites</i> frequents bare plains and
  loves the ground; <i>Serpophaga</i> and <i>Sayornis</i> haunt streams, and flirt the tail like a
  Wagtail; <i>Fluvicola</i>, <i>Alectrurus</i>, and <i>Cyanotis</i> inhabit reed-beds, and climb
  about the bending stems in Tit-like fashion; the Taeniopterinae are mainly terrestrial, and often
  form flocks, <i>Myiotheretes</i> running and flying like a Thrush, and even accompanying bands of
  Plovers; <i>Machetornis</i> searches the backs of cattle for insects, and dusts itself like a
  Lark. Many members of the family are decidedly shy, but the majority are otherwise, and in
  especial the Tyranninae, which are excessively bold and pugnacious when breeding, attacking even
  the Carrion-Hawk (<i>Milvago</i>), and bullying their smaller relatives. In a fair number of
  species the sexes are usually observed apart; in others they are as invariably in company. The
  range extends to ten thousand feet or more in the Andes, <i>Muscisaxicola macloviana</i> being
  found at that altitude, as well as down to the sea-coast in Patagonia; while in some cases
  semi-migratory movements take place at certain times of year. The powers of wing are commonly
  great, especially in the agile King-bird and its congeners; <i>Taenioptera</i> and
  <i>Agriornis</i> can fly as well as hop; <i>Centrites</i>, though of terrestrial habits, moves
  swiftly or circles easily in the air; <i>Pitangus</i> and <i>Empidonax minimus</i> quarter the
  ground for food with undulating movements. <i>Pyrocephalus rubineus</i> soars with upraised
  vibrating wings to a considerable height, with many a rise and fall; <i>Alectrurus tricolor</i>
  goes slowly and vertically up with rapid pulsations of the pinions, and then comes slanting down;
  while the graceful Scissor-tail (<i>Milvulus</i>) twists and turns about in the air, alternately
  opening and shutting its long forked rectrices, or whirling aloft at will to dart earthwards again
  like a rocket.</p>

  <p>The usual note is shrill, piercing, and often harsh or angry, as in <i>Tyrannus</i>,
  <i>Myiarchus</i>, and <i>Machetornis</i>; it is loud, grating, and rarely mellow, in
  <i>Pitangus</i> and <i>Cybernetes</i>; a low plaintive whistle or pipe is uttered by
  <i>Myiotheretes</i>, <i>Cyanotis</i>, and most of the Taeniopterinae, <i>Sayornis</i> having a
  ringing cry, <i>supposed</i> to resemble "Phoebe," which name it bears in North America, and
  <i>Fluvicola</i> and <i>Cnipolegus</i> giving vent to clicking sounds. Many species twitter,
  chirp, or chatter, while <i>Pyrocephalus rubineus</i>, <i>Hapalocercus flaviventer</i>,
  <i>Ornithion imberbe</i>, <i>Contopus ardesiacus</i>, and <i>Empidonax flaviventer</i> are stated
  to have a pleasant trill approaching a song. These notes may be uttered by the birds either when
  soaring in the air or when stationary. The food normally consists of insects, caught upon the wing
  with an audible snap of the bill; but <i>Taenioptera</i> often, instead of hawking from a perch,
  pounces upon crawling beetles, grasps them in its claws, and devours them upon the earth.
  <i>Pitangus bolivianus</i> and some other forms even eat mice, young birds, small snakes, lizards,
  fishes, frogs, spiders, molluscs, worms, and insect-larvae, beating the larger creatures upon a
  branch to kill them. <i>Elainea strepera</i>, <i>Myiarchus crinitus</i>, and some species of
  <i>Tyrannus</i>, will eat berries and seeds. A bulky nest is often fashioned of rough twigs, moss,
  grass, straws, wool, hair, and rags; which may be open as in <i>Tyrannus</i>, or domed as in
  <i>Pitangus bolivianus</i>, and placed in trees in either case: or it may be beautifully felted
  with moss, lichens, and spiders'-webs, and lined with hair and feathers, as in <i>Elainea</i> and
  <i>Serpophaga</i>. <i>Sayornis</i> commonly makes a foundation of mud pellets, adding coarse
  materials above with feathers for bedding, the fabric being fixed to rocks or buildings. Again,
  many species build slight or fairly compact nests of grass, twigs, and softer materials <span
  class="pagenum" id="page477"><span class="smaller">{477}</span></span>in bushes, forks, or
  outgrowths of trees. <i>Copurus</i>, <i>Taenioptera</i>, <i>Machetornis</i>, and <i>Myiarchus</i>
  commonly use old holes of Woodpeckers; <i>Todirostrum</i> and <i>Fluvicola</i> often make hanging
  purse-like structures; <i>Cyanotis</i> attaches its conical nest of papery reeds to the stems of
  those plants; <i>Serpophaga</i> frequently suspends its domicile to twigs, roots, or
  <i>grasses</i> overhanging water; <i>Alectrurus</i>, <i>Lichenops</i>, <i>Hapalocercus</i>, and
  <i>Centrites</i> build in rush- or grass-tufts, and <i>Muscisaxicola</i> under stones.
  <i>Taenioptera</i> and <i>Machetornis</i>, moreover, will lay in the "ovens" of <i>Furnarius</i>,
  or in the nests of <i>Anumbius acuticaudus</i> (<span class="wnw">pp. <a
  href="#page486">486</a></span>, <a href="#page487">487</a>). <i>Muscivora mexicana</i> makes a
  curious hanging spindle-shaped nest, surrounded by loose materials. The eggs are usually whitish,
  salmon- or cream-coloured, and may be unspotted, or dotted and ringed with red, purple, or brown;
  those of <i>Pyrocephalus rubineus</i> have black and grey markings, those of <i>Machetornis</i>
  dense brown stripes or spots, those of <i>Myiarchus</i> tangled purple or red-brown lines and
  marblings, while those of <i>Centrites niger</i> are plain bluish-green.</p>

  <p>Fam. V. <b>Oxyrhamphidae.</b>&ndash;The members differ from the <i>Tyrannidae</i> in the
  straight bill, and the serrated outer web of the tenth primary of the male. The sole genus
  <i>Oxyrhamphus</i> has three greenish forms, with red crests, and black-spotted yellow or white
  lower parts.</p>

  <p>Fam. VI. <b>Pipridae.</b>&ndash;The Manakins, often considered a sub-section of the Cotingidae,
  are for the most part small thick-set birds, though <i>Heteropelma</i> and some other genera have
  greater dimensions. The seventy or more species may be divided into the Sub-families,
  <i>Piprinae</i>, with brilliant males, and <i>Ptilochlorinae</i>, where the sexes are usually
  dull-coloured and similar;<a id="NtA_269" href="#Nt_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a> the former ranging
  from South Mexico to North Argentina, the latter to South-East Brazil. The curved bill is
  generally short and wide at the base in the Piprinae, with an indistinct terminal notch; but is
  somewhat elongated, much compressed, decidedly notched, and usually provided with rictal bristles
  in the Ptilochlorinae. The metatarsus is exaspidean (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page473">473</a></span>)&ndash;though nearly smooth in <i>Metopothrix</i> and
  <i>Masius</i>&ndash;and is comparatively slender in most of the Piprinae, stronger in the
  Ptilochlorinae, <i>Piprites</i>, and <i>Ceratopipra</i>; the outer and mid-toes being partially
  united. The exterior of the ten primaries is always short, while the wing is much elongated in
  <i>Chloropipo</i>; the secondaries are nine or ten. <span class="pagenum" id="page478"><span
  class="smaller">{478}</span></span>In the males of some forms the remiges differ from those of the
  females; thus the shafts of the primaries are thickened and pointed in <i>Chiroxiphia</i>, similar
  but incurved in <i>Helicura</i> and <i>Chiromachaeris</i>, with much attenuated barbs in the
  latter; in <i>Ptilochloris</i> the seventh primary is modified and bends outwards. In
  <i>Machaeropterus</i> the wing-bones are flattened; the secondaries have thick stems bending
  inwards towards the tip, and shew reduced vanes, save the eighth and ninth, while the sixth and
  seventh have the shaft terminally developed into a horny excrescence. The tail is usually short
  and square, but is long in <i>Chloropipo</i> and <i>Metopia</i>, rounded in the latter and
  <i>Masius</i>, graduated in <i>Metopothrix</i> and <i>Heterocercus</i>. The outer of the twelve
  feathers are much elongated in <i>Cirrhopipra</i>, being acuminate in <i>C. heterocerca</i>,
  curved and filiform in <i>C. filicauda</i>; the two median rectrices are lengthened in
  <i>Helicura</i>; while in three species of <i>Chiroxiphia</i> they are also long, or even linear
  in <i>C. linearis</i>. Frontal crests occur in <i>Metopia</i>, <i>Masius</i>, and
  <i>Metopothrix</i>; vertical crests in <i>Pipra serena</i>, <i>P. suavissima</i>, and four species
  of <i>Chiroxiphia</i>; <i>Ceratopipra</i> has a peculiar extended nuchal tuft,
  <i>Chiromachaeris</i> an elongated beard.</p>

  <p>As examples of coloration we may take the following:&ndash;<i>Chloropipo flavicapilla</i> has a
  yellow head, neck, and under parts, a green back, and brownish wings; <i>Xenopipo atronitens</i>
  is uniform black; <i>Ceratopipra cornuta</i>, black with scarlet head, neck, and thighs;
  <i>Cirrhopipra filicauda</i> similarly coloured, with yellow forehead and lower surface. <i>Pipra
  leucocilla</i> is black with a white crown; <i>P. velutina</i> has a blue cap, <i>P.
  suavissima</i> an erect white vertical crest, lilac rump, and orange mid-abdomen.
  <i>Machaeropterus regulus</i> exhibits green upper parts, a scarlet crown, slaty wing- and
  tail-quills, and white, green, and rufous under surface. <i>Chiroxiphia pareola</i> is black, with
  blue mantle and crimson crest; <i>Chiromachaeris aurantiaca</i> is also black, with orange nuchal
  band, cheeks and breast, green rump, and yellow abdomen. The females are green, with yellowish or
  whitish tints below. <span class="pagenum" id="page479"><span
  class="smaller">{479}</span></span><i>Ptilochloris squamata</i> is in both sexes olive-green, with
  blackish cap and wings, and yellowish under parts marked with black; others again of the
  Ptilochlorinae are chiefly olive or rufous,<a id="NtA_270" href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a>
  three species of <i>Heteropelma</i> having concealed coronal patches of yellow.</p>

  <p>Manakins as a rule inhabit deep forests, or thick undergrowth near marshes, where they
  incessantly creep about the branches like Tits, and take short flights after passing insects.
  <i>Chiroxiphia caudata</i> is called in Brazil the "Fandango-bird," from the fact that one
  individual often sits and sings, while its fellows dance up and down to the music. Two males of
  <i>C. linearis</i> have been seen skipping before a female, and uttering meanwhile their cry of
  "to-le-do." <i>Chiromachaeris</i> makes a sound like a whip cracking, followed by a continuous
  rattle&ndash;possibly caused by the wings; but this noise seems peculiar to the genus, the usual
  cry being loud and whistling. Fruits of all sorts, especially berries and seeds, and occasionally
  insects, form the food. <i>Chiromachaeris manacus</i> and <i>Chiroxiphia caudata</i> hang loose,
  shallow nests of grass&ndash;the latter with slight additions of wool, hair, tendrils, and
  leaves&ndash;from the forks of low shrubs; the two eggs being reddish-or yellowish-white, thickly
  blotched with red or brown.</p>

  <p>Fam. VII. <b>Cotingidae.</b>&ndash;This group, divided by Mr. Sclater<a id="NtA_271"
  href="#Nt_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a> into the Sub-families <i>Tityrinae</i>, <i>Lipauginae</i>,
  <i>Attilinae</i>, <i>Rupicolinae</i>, <i>Cotinginae</i>, and <i>Gymnoderinae</i>, contains more
  than a hundred species; but the <i>Attilinae</i> are sometimes placed in the Tyrannidae or the
  Formicariidae, <i>Iodopleura</i> and <i>Calyptura</i> in the Pipridae. The range extends from
  South Mexico to Argentina, <i>Carpodectes</i> being restricted to Costa Rica and Nicaragua,
  <i>Phoenicocercus</i>, <i>Haematoderus</i>, and <i>Gymnocephalus</i> to Guinea and Amazonia,
  <i>Doliornis</i> to Central Peru, <i>Tijuca</i>, <i>Phibalura</i>, and <i>Calyptura</i> to South
  Brazil.</p>

  <p>The bill varies from strong, elongated, compressed, and curved, as in <i>Tijuca</i>, the
  Tityrinae and Attilinae, to short and broad, as in <i>Phibalura</i>, <i>Querula</i>, and
  <i>Chasmorhynchus</i>; the culmen being particularly elevated in <i>Gymnoderus</i>, and much
  hooked in the Attilinae. The metatarsus, scutellated in front, and usually covered with small
  round scales behind (pycnaspidean), is especially strong in <i>Pyroderus</i> and <i>Rupicola</i>,
  partly feathered in the latter, and posteriorly corrugated in <i>Lipaugus</i>; while <i>Attila</i>
  and other kindred forms have the outer toes somewhat <span class="pagenum" id="page480"><span
  class="smaller">{480}</span></span>connected. The wings may be long, as in <i>Carpodectes</i> and
  <i>Iodopleura</i>, or short as in <i>Phoenicocercus</i> and <i>Calyptura</i>; the ten primaries,
  of which the outer is small, are much reduced and twisted in <i>Chirocylla</i>&ndash;particularly
  in the male; in that sex of <i>Rupicola</i> some have the inner web cut away at the tip, while the
  external secondaries have the outer vanes filamentous; the Tityrinae have the ninth primary
  abbreviated and often scimetar-shaped; the seventh has a terminal horny process in the male of
  <i>Phoenicocercus</i>. The secondaries are ten or eleven. In <i>Xipholena</i> the greater coverts
  are stiff and elongated. The tail of twelve rectrices is usually moderate and square; though very
  short in the Cotinginae, long in <i>Tijuca</i>, deeply forked in <i>Phibalura</i>, and nearly
  hidden by its coverts in <i>Cotinga amabilis</i>. Bristles surround the gape in the Lipauginae and
  Attilinae, but vary elsewhere; <i>Rupicola</i> has a large compressed crest, <i>Cephalopterus</i>
  (Fig. 103), one like an umbrella, <i>Phoenicocercus</i>, <i>Doliornis</i>, <i>Heliochera</i>,
  <i>Calyptura</i>, and <i>Phibalura</i> moderate tufts. Wattles and naked areas occur in
  <i>Chasmorhynchus</i> and <i>Cephalopterus</i>; some species of <i>Tityra</i> have the lores and
  orbits bare; <i>Gymnoderus</i> has the sides of the head and the whole neck, <i>Gymnocephalus</i>
  the entire head unfeathered.</p>

  <p>The plumage is ordinarily plain rufous, green, or grey; the females being nearly always dull,
  though many of the males are very brilliant. Among these <i>Tityra</i> exhibits black and white
  hues, <i>Hadrostomus</i> is chiefly grey or black, with a rosy band below in three cases,
  <i>Pachyrhamphus</i> is green, black, yellow, rufous, or grey, sometimes varied with white.
  <i>Lathria streptophora</i> has a pink collar, <i>Aulia</i> irregular black spots below.
  <i>Phoenicocercus carnifex</i> is dark brown, with scarlet crown, rump, most of the tail and under
  parts; <i>Rupicola crocea</i>, the well-known Cock of the Rock, is bright orange, with brown and
  white wings and partly blackish rectrices; <i>Phibalura flavirostris</i> is black and yellow with
  concealed scarlet crest; <i>Tijuca</i> is black, with yellow on the wing; <i>Ampelion</i> is
  green, relieved by brown, black, and yellow; <i>Pipreola</i> is green, with black, scarlet,
  yellow, or orange markings on the throat or breast; <i>Cotinga</i> exhibits splendid blue and
  purple tints; <i>Xipholena pompadora</i> has an unusual reddish-purple hue, coupled with almost
  white wings. <i>Carpodectes</i> is snowy white, with leaden-coloured or yellow bill;
  <i>Heliochera</i> has black, grey, white, or yellow coloration, with a chestnut crest;
  <i>Iodopleura</i> shews a lilac tuft on each side of the breast; and <i>Calyptura</i> <span
  class="pagenum" id="page481"><span class="smaller">{481}</span></span>is chiefly greenish-yellow,
  with a scarlet, black-edged crest. Of the peculiar Gymnoderinae, <i>Haematoderus</i>, which has
  elongated head-, neck-, rump-, and breast-feathers, is crimson with brown wings and tail, the
  female having brown on the back; <i>Querula</i> is dull black with a red collar of lengthened
  plumes; <i>Pyroderus</i> is black with crimson throat and fore-neck. <i>Cephalopterus ornatus</i>,
  the Umbrella-bird, is entirely black, with a huge expanded umbrella-like crest of bare-shafted
  incurved feathers, and a long flattened and feathered gular wattle; <i>C. penduliger</i> has this
  appendage extraordinarily long and cylindrical; <i>C. glabricollis</i> a bare orange throat with a
  terminal tuft on the red outgrowth. <i>Chasmorhynchus niveus</i> is white, with a spiral erectile
  process on the forehead, thinly covered with white feathers: <i>C. nudicollis</i> has the cheeks
  and throat naked and bristly, but lacks the excrescence; <i>C. variegatus</i> is white, with a
  brown head, black wings, and bare papillose throat; <i>C. tricarunculatus</i> is chestnut, with a
  white head bearing three caruncles, on the forehead and at the gape. In this genus the females are
  green above and chiefly yellow below. The bill may be orange or red in the Family, while
  <i>Gymnoderus</i> alone has large white powder-down patches on the flanks.</p>

  <p>The habits of these woodland birds are comparatively little known, but most of them frequent
  high trees, though some prefer low bushes; such forms as <i>Lipaugus</i> and <i>Heteropelma</i>
  haunt dense forests, <i>Pipreola</i> and <i>Phibalura</i> more open situations, while small flocks
  often occur at considerable elevations, <i>Heliochera</i> reaching ten thousand feet.
  <i>Cephalopterus ornatus</i> loves islands in rivers, <i>Chasmorhynchus</i> and <i>Xenopsaris</i>
  marshy glades or even sedge-growth. The flight, usually of short duration, is heavy and noisy in
  <i>Pipreola</i> and elsewhere, Swallow-like in <i>Phibalura</i>; insects are often captured on the
  wing, and not only these but spiders, molluscs, and even lizards, are occasionally sought upon the
  ground. Berries, seeds, and the like, however, constitute the chief food. <i>Cephalopterus</i> and
  <i>Hadrostomus</i>, at least occasionally, beat their prey upon a branch before swallowing it. The
  members of this Family are usually somewhat shy and dull, but the males of <i>Rupicola</i> were
  observed by Schomburgk to dance in turn with outspread wings before an assembled flock, strutting
  and parading with frequent leaps. This bird is credited with a voice like a monkey;
  <i>Chasmorhynchus niveus</i> is termed Campanero or Bell-bird from its clear, bell-like note,
  uttered with the caruncle erected, while its congeners have also ringing cries;
  <i>Cephalopterus</i> gives vent to long deep "lowings" at sunrise and sunset. <i>Tityra
  semifasciata</i> utters frog-like sounds, <i>Pachyrhamphus</i> a loud whistle, and other species
  notes resembling those of Tanagers, Tyrants, or Wrens. <i>Rupicola</i> fastens a nest of mud,
  surmounted by twigs and lined with moss, to projections of rocks <span class="pagenum"
  id="page483"><span class="smaller">{483}</span></span>in damp, sunless caves, laying two buff eggs
  with reddish-brown and lilac spots; <i>Pyroderus orenocensis</i> deposits similar eggs on
  platforms of sticks placed in tree-forks; <i>Tityra semifasciata</i> lines holes in decayed limbs
  with dry grass to receive its white eggs; <i>Hadrostomus niger</i>, <i>H. homochrous</i>, and some
  species of <i>Pachyrhamphus</i>, hang big nests of such materials as leaves, plant-stalks and
  wool, with side entrances, from low branches; the two to four eggs, where known, being chocolate,
  faintly marked or unspotted; <i>Phibalura</i> fixes a cup of lichens in the crotch of a large
  tree, laying twice annually two greenish-blue eggs with neutral markings; <i>Cephalopterus</i> is
  said to make a rough nest of sticks; and <i>Pipreola riefferi</i> to deposit pale salmon-coloured
  eggs, sparingly spotted with reddish-brown.</p>

  <p>Fam. VIII. <b>Phytotomidae.</b>&ndash;The Plant-cutters constitute a single genus
  <i>Phytotoma</i>, of four Finch-like species, having strongly serrated bills and pycnaspidean
  (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page479">479</a></span>) metatarsi. The primaries number ten, the
  secondaries nine, the rectrices twelve. <i>P. rara</i> of Chili is brown and black, with red crown
  and lower surface, white margins to the wing-coverts, and red-banded lateral tail-feathers; the
  female has yellowish-brown under parts streaked with black, and a brown crown. <i>P. raimondii</i>
  of North-West Peru is somewhat like, but has only a narrow red frontlet; <i>P. angustirostris</i>
  of Bolivia is greyer, with white on the secondaries and tail, and a browner breast; the hen being
  chiefly greyish, with black striations above and spots below; <i>P. rutila</i> of Argentina and
  North Patagonia is very similar. Flocks or pairs of Plant-eaters are found in dry open situations,
  the former often consisting solely of the comparatively unsuspicious males; they sit aloft on
  bushes, but hide when alarmed. The flight is whirring with sudden short undulations; the food
  consists of seeds and other fruits, tender shoots, buds and leaves; while the voice is decidedly
  harsh, the alarm-note of the male resembles the bleating of a kid, and the female's cry is
  cricket-like. The slight, shallow nest of twigs and fibres is placed in thick bushes, and contains
  four bluish-green eggs, flecked with brown. The birds are said to cut plants off close to the
  ground without apparent object.</p>

  <p>The four Families that follow are often classed as <i>Tracheophonae</i>, and have loud voices
  owing to their tracheal syrinx (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page22">22</a></span>).</p>

  <p>Fam. IX. <b>Dendrocolaptidae.</b>&ndash;This group, with over 200 species, occupies the
  Neotropical Region, excluding the Antilles, <span class="pagenum" id="page484"><span
  class="smaller">{484}</span></span>and is divided by Mr. Sclater<a id="NtA_272"
  href="#Nt_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> into the Sub-families <i>Furnariinae</i>, <i>Synallaxinae</i>,
  <i>Philydorinae</i>, <i>Sclerurinae</i>, and <i>Dendrocolaptinae</i>.</p>

  <p>The extremely variable bill is short and straight in <i>Geobates</i> and <i>Henicornis</i>,
  Warbler-like in the Synallaxinae, stouter and Shrike-like in the Philydorinae, extremely strong in
  <i>Hylexetastes</i>, short and incurved in <i>Xenerpestes</i> and <i>Phacellodomus</i>, short with
  upturned genys in <i>Glyphorhynchus</i>, <i>Xenops</i>, and <i>Pygarrhicus</i>, very long, thin,
  and decurved in <i>Xiphorhynchus</i>, very long, but only slightly curved in <i>Nasica</i>, and so
  forth. It is much hooked in <i>Ancistrops</i>. The endaspidean<a id="NtA_273"
  href="#Nt_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a> metatarsus may be long and slender, as in
  <i>Sylviorthorhynchus</i>; stronger, as in the terrestrial Furnariinae and Sclerurinae; or
  shorter, as in the scansorial Dendrocolaptinae, which usually have large toes and sharp claws. The
  scales are almost obsolete in <i>Furnarius</i> and <i>Lochmias</i>; the outer and middle toes are
  partially connected in the Sclerurinae and Dendrocolaptinae. The wings, which have ten primaries
  and about nine secondaries, are long in <i>Pseudocolaptes</i>, moderate in <i>Xenerpestes</i>,
  short and rounded in <i>Lochmias</i>, and frequently decidedly abbreviated. The variable tail,
  normally of twelve rectrices, is often graduated; the shafts of the quills are stiffened and spiny
  in the Sclerurinae and Dendrocolaptinae, the latter of which climb and feed in Woodpecker fashion;
  in the Synallaxinae it is generally long, with pointed but comparatively soft feathers; in the
  Philydorinae it is short, <i>Anumbius</i> having particularly sharp rhachides. It is also short,
  though rounded, in <i>Xenerpestes</i>, <i>Coryphistera</i>, and <i>Limnophyes</i>, similar but
  longer in <i>Clibanornis</i>, while it has the shafts projecting beyond the vanes in
  <i>Homorus</i>, <i>Oxyurus</i>, and <i>Sittosomus</i>. <i>Schizoeaca</i> and <i>Synallaxis</i>
  have only ten rectrices, and <i>Sylviorthorhynchus</i> apparently possesses but six, the outer
  being very short and the inner excessively long with narrow decomposed webs. <i>Limnornis</i>, at
  least, has the tongue bristly towards the end.</p>

  <p>The coloration is chiefly brown of various shades, often with the tail chestnut&ndash;or,
  rarely, the body, as in <i>Homorus</i>; spots, striations, or cross-bars, of white, fulvous, or
  black occur frequently, and <i>Margarornis</i> has pearl-like markings below. The rump or under
  parts may be white, and the throat occasionally exhibits a black, rufous or yellow patch, or the
  breast a chestnut band; while black, rusty, brown, or grey caps are not uncommon, that of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page485"><span class="smaller">{485}</span></span><i>Siptornis albiceps</i>
  being white. The bill may be red, or exceptionally the feet white, as in <i>Furnarius
  leucopus</i>. Crests are found in <i>F. cristatus</i>, <i>Synallaxis semicinerea</i>,
  <i>Coryphistera</i>, and <i>Homorus</i>. The sexes, as far as known, are similar. The large
  <i>Drymornis bridgesi</i> is over a foot long, but many forms are not half that size, and most are
  comparatively small.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 105.</span>&ndash;Nest of Oven-bird (<i>Furnarius</i>). &times;
      &#x2155;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The habits are extremely diverse. <i>Geositta cunicularia</i> flits along low and swiftly, like
  a Wheatear, with the tail in motion, or crouches and runs before the pedestrian, uttering a note
  resembling piti-piti, varied by a ringing trill. It frequents bare spots, and bores oblique
  tunnels in biscacha burrows, sandy banks, or mud walls, ending in cavities lined with soft
  grasses, where it lays five white eggs. The food consists of seeds, insects, and their larvae, the
  bill being commonly used to dig. <i>Lochmias nematura</i> fills a similar hole with a large-domed
  nest of twigs and roots, lined with leaves, which contains two white eggs. The Oven-birds
  (<i>Furnarius</i>) run or hop unconcernedly among the wayfarers with the head thrown back, or
  pause with one foot uplifted; they utter incessant and loud, but not unmelodious, cries with the
  beak outstretched, which are even heard at night.<a id="NtA_274"
  href="#Nt_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a> Worms, <span class="pagenum" id="page486"><span
  class="smaller">{486}</span></span>insects and their larvae are sought upon the ground, and both
  sexes incubate, the pairs keeping together throughout the year. The curious nest (Fig. 105) is
  placed in exposed situations on branches, in forks of trees or shrubs, on posts, rocks, or
  house-roofs; it has thick walls, almost unbreakable when dry, of clayey mud and dung mixed with a
  little hair or dry grass, a lining of the same materials underlying the three to five white eggs.
  This massive structure has an inner chamber with an outer passage running partly round it, and is
  generally the work of several months, the materials being only procurable in damp weather. The
  above refers at least to <i>Furnarius cinnamomeus</i>, <i>F. minor</i>, and <i>F. rufus</i> (the
  "Hornero" or Baker); but White<a id="NtA_275" href="#Nt_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a> states that
  <i>F. figulus</i> builds a stick nest, and E. Bartlett<a id="NtA_276"
  href="#Nt_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a> that <i>F. torridus</i> deposits four creamy white eggs on
  twigs and bents in holes in banks. <i>Upucerthia</i>, resembling <i>Geositta</i> in general
  habits, ranges to an altitude of nine thousand feet. The lively <i>Cinclodes</i> recalls both the
  Wheatear and the Dipper, as it runs with upturned tail from stone to stone, takes short, low
  flights, or hunts for crustaceans, molluscs, and insects in the water, equally happy on the
  streams of the Andes, or the desolate lake-sides of Patagonia. The note is a sharp trill, while
  three white eggs are laid on a bed of grass and fur in holes. <i>Sclerurus</i> frequents damp
  forests, scratching among the leaves, and crouching, when startled, on some trunk.
  <i>Phloeocryptes</i> flies weakly, but hops actively about reed-beds in pursuit of flies, uttering
  reiterated grating notes; it attaches its Wren-like nest of grass or rushes and mud, lined with
  feathers, moss and hair, to a few of the reed-stems, and builds a projection over the entrance.
  The two or three oval eggs are glossy blue. The shrill-voiced <i>Leptasthenura</i> clings to the
  branches in search of insects like a Tit, and lays from three to six pointed white eggs on soft
  materials in holes in trees, sometimes utilizing nests of <i>Furnarius rufus</i>, <i>Siptornis
  sordida</i>, and other species. <i>Synallaxis</i>, usually seen in pairs searching for food upon
  the bushes, has a persistent harsh double call or a cat-like cry; it forms a loose, oval
  structure, which would fill an ordinary wheel-barrow, of thorny sticks and twigs in forks of
  trees, lining it with hair, feathers, woolly leaves,and the like, and often capping it with more
  leaves. This generally possesses a lower chamber connected by a vertical or horizontal passage
  with the entrance, itself protected by a tubular fabric; while more than <span class="pagenum"
  id="page487"><span class="smaller">{487}</span></span>one nest is often found in the same tree.
  The three or four eggs are pale greenish-blue or whitish. <i>Siptornis sordida</i> appears to have
  similar habits, but several of its congeners run like mice; or conceal themselves in herbage or
  holes, the marsh-loving species uttering very whirring notes. <i>S. sulphurifera</i> fabricates a
  domed nest of grass among rushes, and lays two white eggs; that of <i>S. maluro&iuml;des</i> is open,
  and lined with feathers and wool, though the site is similar; that of <i>S. striaticeps</i>
  resembles the last-mentioned, but is placed in a tree-fork and contains four or five white eggs.
  <i>S. hudsoni</i> arches the grass over a hollow in the ground in open spots, and deposits five
  pale buff eggs on a little powdered dung; its flight is Pipit-like, and its cry melancholy.
  <i>Phacellodomus</i>, usually found in hot dry valleys, is sluggish, and has a shrill, harsh
  voice; the nest, containing four white eggs, being hung from the end of a branch, and recalling
  that of <i>Synallaxis</i>. <i>Xenops</i>, <i>Sittosomus</i>, <i>Picolaptes</i>,
  <i>Xiphorhynchus</i>, <i>Pseudocolaptes</i>, and many other forms are denizens of damp forests,
  and run up the tree-trunks spirally like Creepers, searching for prey and tapping the bark as
  Woodpeckers do; the cries are plaintive or noisy, and the white eggs, apparently two in number,
  are laid in holes. Large insects are sometimes battered upon the branches. <i>Anumbius
  acuticaudus</i>, the "Thorn-bird" or "Firewood Gatherer," makes a bulky nest some two feet high of
  thorny sticks, and places it in isolated trees. From an entrance near the top a spiral or zigzag
  passage leads to a lower cavity lined with grass, hair, feathers, and wool, where five pointed
  white eggs are deposited; while sometimes an upper roosting chamber is added. This bird utters
  ticking chirps or trills, and feeds mainly upon the ground, regaining the branches with
  difficulty. <i>Homorus lophotes</i>, the "Cachalote," with its strikingly white eyes and blue
  beak, haunts plains with scattered trees or bushes, being decidedly shy and quick of foot, though
  weak of flight; it eats insects, and turns up the earth with its bill or claws. Rasping cries are
  often emitted in concert; while the nest&ndash;even larger than that of <i>Anumbius</i>&ndash;is a
  loose mass of similar structure, placed on some low branch or in a bush, the three or four white
  eggs occasionally shewing through the bottom. <i>Drymornis</i>, again, has Woodpecker-like habits,
  whereas <i>Limnornis</i> and <i>Limnophyes</i> creep about dense reed-beds, and only appear now
  and then to utter jarring or chattering sounds.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page488"><span class="smaller">{488}</span></span></div>

  <p>Fam. X. <b>Formicariidae.</b>&ndash;The so-called "Ant-birds"&ndash;not known to live on
  ants&ndash;are plentiful in the forests of northern South America, whence the numbers decrease to
  Central America, Chili and Argentina. Of the two hundred or more species none inhabit the
  Antilles, but three occur in Trinidad and one in Tobago. Mr. Sclater<a id="NtA_277"
  href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> allows as provisional Sub-families the strong
  <i>Thamnophilinae</i>, the weaker <i>Formicariinae</i>, and the long-legged
  <i>Grallariinae</i>.</p>

  <p>The beak is strong, compressed, hooked, and terminally toothed in the Thamnophilinae, being
  exaggerated in <i>Batara</i>, large and swollen in <i>Cymbilanius</i>, and exceptionally hooked in
  the former genus and <i>Pygoptila</i>; <i>Cymbilanius</i>, <i>Neoctantes</i>, and
  <i>Clytoctantes</i> have the genys upturned. In the Formicariinae the bill is weaker and but
  slightly hooked, being very long and thin in <i>Rhamphocaenus</i>; in the Grallariinae it is
  usually elevated and compressed, though broad in <i>Pittasoma</i>. The taxaspidean metatarsus
  (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page471">471</a></span>) is moderate or short in the
  Thamnophilinae, and remarkably long in the Grallariinae, where it may be very strong, as in
  <i>Pittasoma</i>; among the Formicariinae it is short and thick in <i>Rhopoterpe</i> and
  <i>Formicivora</i>, long and thin in <i>Psilorhamphus</i> and <i>Formicarius</i>, and so forth. In
  <i>Phlogopsis</i>, <i>Psilorhamphus</i>, <i>Rhamphocaenus</i>, <i>Heterocnemis</i>,
  <i>Myrmeciza</i>, <i>Hypocnemis</i>, <i>Pithys</i>, and <i>Gymnopithys</i> the scutes are nearly
  fused. The outer and middle toes are joined towards the base. The wings, which have ten primaries
  and nine secondaries, are normally short and rounded, though longer in <i>Rhopoterpe</i>; the tail
  is commonly long and broad in the Thamnophilinae, varies greatly in the Formicariinae, and is very
  short and square in the Grallariinae. It may be rounded or graduated in the first two
  Sub-families, and <i>Terenura</i> has it remarkably thin; <i>Cercomacra</i>, <i>Formicivora
  caudata</i>, and <i>F. ferruginea</i> have only ten rectrices in place of the usual twelve.
  <i>Thamnomanes</i> has well-developed rictal bristles, <i>Rhamphocaenus</i> has the nostrils in a
  groove and partly covered by a membrane.</p>

  <p>The sexes are similar, and mainly reddish-brown, in <i>Rhamphocaenus</i>, <i>Phlogopsis</i>,
  and the Grallariinae; but generally the males are black and white, black, grey and brown, or
  uniform black; and the females ferruginous, more or less relieved by black and white. Cross-bars,
  spots, and striations are not uncommon, the white often shewing as a band on the tail, an edging
  to the wing-coverts, or exceptionally, as in <i>Pygoptila margaritata</i>, as <span
  class="pagenum" id="page489"><span class="smaller">{489}</span></span>round spots on both wing and
  tail; while the yellowish lower parts of <i>Myrmotherula pygmaea</i>, <i>Herpsilochmus
  rufimarginatus</i> and three species of <i>Terenura</i> exhibit the brightest tints found in the
  Family. Black or dark-hued caps are not infrequent; crests occur in <i>Batara</i>, <i>Pithys</i>,
  and many members of <i>Thamnophilus</i>; the rump-feathers are often dense and elongated, as in
  <i>Thamnistes</i>, <i>Pygoptila</i>, <i>Chamaeza</i>, <i>Cercomacra</i>, and <i>Thamnomanes</i>;
  those of the flanks are much developed in <i>Thamnocharis</i>; those of the lores are short and
  erect in <i>Pyriglena</i>. Bare red or bluish orbits are found occasionally; <i>Gymnocichla</i>
  has most of the head naked and blue; and the irides may be red, white, or brown. <i>Batara</i> is
  quite fourteen inches long, <i>Myrmotherula pygmaea</i> about three.</p>

  <p>The usually shy and retiring Formicariidae either skulk among dense undergrowth in hot tropical
  forests, or frequent more cultivated districts; they creep about silently, singly or in pairs,
  seeking spiders, insects and their larvae, on the twigs and foliage of trees, or on parasitical
  plants or grasses; while they habitually keep near the ground, though sometimes joining flocks of
  other birds in their higher flights. Many carefully search the lower surface of the leaves for
  food with the head downwards, and occasionally eat seeds. The Grallariinae appear to be entirely,
  and the Formicariinae to a great extent terrestrial, hops being the characteristic mode of
  progress; the tail is commonly carried erect or in motion, as in the case of <i>Formicarius</i>,
  and is often much abraded by the thorny thickets. <i>Thamnophilus albinuchalis</i> and some other
  species choose dry situations, but generally the vicinity of water is preferred. The ordinary note
  in the Family is deep and powerful, and is said to have the effect of ventriloquism; it consists
  of monotonously repeated sounds, like ke-ke-ke or ko-ko-ko, varied by more rasping tones or
  trills. The nest, a slight shallow structure, generally hung from the lower twigs of a tree or
  bush, is composed of straws, fibres, roots, and hair, or occasionally of leaves, moss, and wool;
  it contains two or three white, bluish, or rufous-brown eggs, usually spotted, streaked, or
  zigzagged with red-brown, but more rarely with grey.</p>

  <p>Fam. XI. <b>Conopophagidae.</b>&ndash;These curious birds, and their equally remarkable allies
  the <i>Pteroptochidae</i>, differ from all other Passeres in having two incisions posteriorly on
  each side of the sternum. The <i>Conopophagidae</i>, extending from Colombia to Bolivia and
  Brazil, include the genus <i>Conopophaga</i>, and probably <span class="pagenum"
  id="page490"><span class="smaller">{490}</span></span><i>Corythopis</i>. The head is large, the
  bill depressed in the first-named, longer and more compressed in the last; the exaspidean
  metatarsus (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page473">473</a></span>) is thick and long in the one,
  with broad curved hind-claw, but is thinner, with straighter and weaker hallux, in the other. The
  outer and middle toes are basally connected. The wings are moderate and rounded, as in the next
  Family; the tail is very short in <i>Conopophaga</i>, which has long, lax rump-feathers. The
  general coloration is brown, with a white mark behind the eye in the last-named genus; the head
  may be black, or chestnut with black sides; the throat black; the breast banded with chestnut,
  black or grey; or the central abdomen white. <i>Corythopis</i> has black striations below.</p>

  <p>Fam. XII. <b>Pteroptochidae.</b>&ndash;This group ranges from Costa Rica to Patagonia,
  occurring up to an altitude of nine or ten thousand feet. The bill is comparatively long and thin
  in <i>Scytalopus</i> and <i>Merulaxis</i>, stronger in <i>Liosceles</i>, <i>Pteroptochus</i>,
  <i>Hylactes</i>, and <i>Rhinocrypta</i>, being much arched in the last-named; the culmen expands
  into a peculiar oval plate in <i>Acropternis</i> and <i>Triptorhinus</i>; while a membrane
  partially covers the nostrils. The taxaspidean metatarsus (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page471">471</a></span>) is generally elongated and strong, with long claws, the hallux
  being long and incurved in <i>Hylactes</i>, and similar but straighter in <i>Acropternis</i>; the
  whole foot is shorter in <i>Rhinocrypta</i>, more slender in <i>Pteroptochus</i>, while the scutes
  are fused in front in <i>Liosceles</i>. The short, rounded wings have ten primaries and eight
  secondaries; the tail varies in length, and may be graduated, as in <i>Merulaxis</i> and
  <i>Acropternis</i>, or short and more even, as in <i>Triptorhinus</i>. <i>Hylactes</i> has
  fourteen rectrices in place of twelve. The colour is blackish, dark grey, or brown, often barred
  or scalloped with black; the crown, rump, breast, or belly are at times chestnut or rufous, the
  lower parts varied with white, or even banded with orange. <i>Merulaxis</i> has long, stiff loral
  plumes, <i>Rhinocrypta lanceolata</i> a crest, and several forms elongated rump-feathers. In
  <i>Acropternis</i> the back and abdomen are ocellated with white. The sexes are nearly
  similar.</p>

  <p class="sp3">These peculiar birds are commonly shy and retiring, hopping actively about with
  erect tails, or running like mice, but rarely flying, except between the boughs and the ground.
  They are decidedly difficult of observation, though they follow up the pedestrian under cover,
  betraying their position by their scolding cries. Many species, such as <i>Hylactes tarnii</i>,
  the "Guid-guid," <i>Pteroptochus rubecula</i>, the "Cheu-can," and <i>Triptorhinus paradoxus</i>,
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page491"><span class="smaller">{491}</span></span>"Cheu-gui,"
  inhabit damp, gloomy forests; others often frequent dry plains, or stony and bushy hill-sides, as
  <i>H. megapodius</i>, "El Turco," and <i>P. albicollis</i>, the "Tapaculo"; while <i>Scytalopus
  magellanicus</i> prefers thick woods, but also haunts grass-lands in the Falkland Islands.
  <i>Rhinocrypta lanceolata</i>, the "Gallito," or Little Cock, lives in thickets and hedges, and
  struts in the open like a Fowl. The food, chiefly obtained upon the ground, consists of insects,
  seeds, and buds. The noisy and generally harsh notes vary considerably, <i>Hylactes tarnii</i>
  yelping like a dog, <i>Pteroptochus albicollis</i> sometimes uttering a sound like a coo,
  <i>Triptorhinus paradoxus</i> a reiterated frog-like croak, <i>Rhinocrypta lanceolata</i> a hollow
  chirrup or a scolding cry. The nest, commonly situated near the ground, is said in some cases to
  be made of sticks; <i>Rhinocrypta</i> forms a domed structure of grass in a bush, and lays four
  eggs; <i>Scytalopus magellanicus</i> is recorded as using a mass of moss upon a bank to contain
  its set of two; <i>Hylactes</i> and <i>Pteroptochus</i> are reported to nest in burrows. The eggs
  are white, at least in the first three.</p>

  <p class="ac">2. <span class="sc">Passeres diacromyodae.</span></p>

  <p class="ac">C. <i>Suboscines.</i></p>

  <p>This group contains only the two Families <i>Menuridae</i> (Lyre-birds) and
  <i>Atrichornithidae</i> (Scrub-birds), each with one genus, <i>Menura</i> and <i>Atrichornis</i>
  respectively. The former possesses three pairs of vocal muscles, the latter only two pairs;<a
  id="NtA_278" href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a> <i>Menura</i>, moreover, has a peculiarly long
  sternum, constricted towards the middle, while <i>Atrichornis</i> has but rudimentary clavicles,
  being thus unique among the Passerine forms.</p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Menuridae.</b>&ndash;Lyre-birds have a stout bill; very long and powerful metatarsi,
  with robust elongated straight claws; and somewhat short rounded wings, with eleven primaries and
  ten secondaries. The tail has sixteen rectrices, and in the males of two species has the exterior
  pair of feathers curved like a lyre, with very narrow outer and very broad inner webs; the next
  six pairs have very distant barbs and no barbules, except towards the base; while the two median
  plumes have narrow inner and no outer webs, and after crossing below, curve boldly outwards. The
  tongue is sagittate, the furcula <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped, the after-shaft
  rudimentary; the adults have no down. <i>M. superba</i> of New South Wales and South Queensland,
  some thirty-three inches long, is <span class="pagenum" id="page492"><span
  class="smaller">{492}</span></span>dull brown, with a slaty tinge above, and more rufous throat,
  wings, and tail-coverts; while the outer rectrices exhibit regular notch-like transparent or
  blackish markings on the chestnut inner webs, caused by the absence of barbules. The naked orbits
  are bluish or lead-coloured. The female has a long, broad, normal tail, the median feathers
  exceeding the rest. <i>M. victoriae</i>, of Victoria, is darker, with more boldly marked outer
  rectrices. <i>M. alberti</i>, of Queensland, and the Richmond and Clarence River districts of New
  South Wales, is redder above, and has the tail less lyrate, the outer feathers being shorter, with
  no transparent notches.</p>

  <p>Lyre-birds haunt precipitous sandy gullies in thick forests with tangled undergrowth, whether
  inland or near the coast; and, though able to fly, live chiefly upon the ground, whence they leap,
  when scared, to branches even ten feet high. They run with the tail horizontal, and scratch among
  fallen leaves for insects&ndash;especially coleoptera&ndash;myriapods, worms, and molluscs; the
  solitary individuals or pairs which are usually observed being particularly shy. Each cock has a
  walk or playground, and scrapes little hillocks or hollows for dancing places, where he struts or
  pirouettes with erect tail and drooping wings, scratching, pecking, and singing at intervals.
  Apparently, however, he is not polygamous. The normal cry is a loud, liquid, gurgling sound; but
  the Pheasants, as the Colonists term them, are clever mockers, imitating a cock's crow, a hen's
  cackle, a dog's bark or howl, the Laughing Jackass's note, or even the setting of a saw. The
  tail-feathers are said to be shed after breeding, and to be fully developed only by the fourth
  year, when males begin to sing. The oval, domed nests, placed on ledges of cliffs, on tops of old
  stumps, in forks of trees, or by fallen logs, are loose bulky masses of sticks, bark, grass,
  leaves, ferns, and moss, lined with roots and the bird's feathers. The one large egg has a
  stone-grey, brown, or dark purple ground-colour, blotched, dotted, and streaked with purplish or
  blackish-brown. The chicks are said to be covered with black down in <i>M. victoriae</i>, white in
  <i>M. alberti</i>, and brownish in <i>M. superba</i>; and to remain six weeks in the nest. The hen
  sits with her tail curled sideways or forwards. The flesh is dark, tough, and unpalatable.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Fam. II. <b>Atrichornithidae.</b>&ndash;<i>Atrichornis</i> has a large bill;
  moderate scutellated metatarsi; extremely short wings with eleven primaries, the outer of which is
  very small, and some eight secondaries; and a long, broad, graduated tail with twelve rectrices.
  The tongue is sagittate, the aftershaft rudimentary, and no down is present on adults. <i>A.
  clamosa</i> of Western Australia, about eight and a half inches in length, is brown above, barred
  with dusky, and reddish-white below, with a black pectoral patch; <i>A. rufescens</i> of New South
  Wales has the lower parts like the upper. The females appear to be unknown. These very shy birds
  haunt dense scrub, or grassy and bushy tracts, being very difficult of observation; they mimic the
  notes of other species cleverly, and also utter a peculiar noisy cry. They scratch in the ground,
  probably for insect-food.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page494"><span class="smaller">{494}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac">D. <i>Oscines.</i></p>

  <p>Of this group, or the true singing birds, the anatomy is even less worked out than that of the
  <i>Suboscines</i>, and consequently the relationships are in many cases extremely doubtful. The
  <i>Hirundinidae</i> stand distinctly apart, with no other Families near them, though some
  similarity of habits, and possibly of structure, may be recognised in certain <i>Muscicapidae</i>
  (especially if <i>Artamus</i> be included among them), and to a less extent in a few
  <i>Sturnidae</i>; yet almost as much resemblance may be perceived in some <i>Tyrannidae</i>, which
  (not being Oscinine) can have no affinity to the <i>Hirundinidae</i>. The likeness is therefore
  probably one of analogy only, and, if so, of no taxonomic value. Here again it must be stated that
  the <i>Oscines</i> hardly attain more than the rank of a Family, and that in the Passeriformes the
  Families have not the same value as in the foregoing Orders.</p>

  <p>The <i>Alaudidae</i> are generally recognisable by the casing of their metatarsi (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page496">496</a></span>), but in other respects they seem to shew an
  affinity to the <i>Motacillidae</i> (<i>Anthinae</i>) on the one hand, and to the
  <i>Fringillidae</i> on the other. The wing-characters, on which reliance was formerly placed,
  prove to be wholly untrustworthy.</p>

  <p>As to the rest of the "Families" of <i>Oscines</i>, it is impossible to indicate their probable
  relations by placing them in sequence, or even at present to group more than a few of them with
  any degree of assurance. Some have not yet been defined at all, and few of them sufficiently for
  anyone to be confident as to their limits. Thus in the <i>Muscicapidae</i> hardly any two
  systematic ornithologists will agree as to which genera should be included and which excluded. If
  restricted to Old World forms, there is still no defined boundary between them and the
  <i>Campephagidae</i>, while there is perhaps even less distinction between them and the
  <i>Sylviidae</i> (or <i>Sylviinae</i>, if these last be included among the <i>Turdidae</i>).
  Moreover, by some taxonomers the <i>Mniotiltidae</i> have been referred to the
  <i>Muscicapidae</i>, and though there is an obvious distinction between them in the number of the
  primaries, the instance of the <i>Alaudidae</i> (already mentioned) shews that this may be of very
  slight importance.</p>

  <p>Some other "Families" may perhaps be grouped with less risk of error. The <i>Troglodytidae</i>,
  <i>Certhiidae</i>, <i>Sittidae</i> and <i>Paridae</i> are possibly such; but the limits of the
  last-named are <span class="pagenum" id="page495"><span
  class="smaller">{495}</span></span>certainly not laid down, and it would be hard to give a good
  reason either for admitting or refusing to admit into it genera like <i>Liothrix</i> or
  <i>Chamaea</i>, while the puzzle is still greater in regard to some forms from Australia and New
  Zealand.</p>

  <p class="sp4">The two latest writers on the subject, Dr. Gadow and Professor Newton, abstain from
  offering any scheme of Classification of the <i>Oscines</i>, the latter limiting himself to the
  declaration, already expressed by the late W. K. Parker, that the Corvidae should stand as the
  highest group. As regards their predecessors it will be enough here to enumerate the "Families" in
  the order in which they were arranged by Dr. Stejneger<a id="NtA_279"
  href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> in 1885, and Dr. Sharpe<a id="NtA_280"
  href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> in 1891; the scheme of the last author, however, being
  reversed to harmonize with the plan of the present volume, in which the lower groups are assigned
  priority. The <i>order</i> of Dr. Stejneger, which is based on both anatomy and morphology, is
  that subsequently followed, but his Families are not invariably adhered to.</p>

  <p>As regards structure, the <i>Oscines</i> have one posterior incision or fenestra on each side
  of the sternum; the furcula is <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped; the tongue is variable, as
  is the syrinx (pp. <a href="#page13">13</a>, <a href="#page21">21</a>, <a href="#page22">22</a>,
  <a href="#page467">467</a>); the nostrils may be pervious or impervious; an after-shaft is nearly
  always present, though comparatively weak; down occurs sparingly on the blind young, and is
  absent, or only found on the unfeathered spaces, in adults. The primaries number ten or eleven;
  the secondaries nineteen, twenty, or even more; the rectrices normally twelve. The form of the
  bill, wings, and tail are discussed under the different Families; the metatarsus exceptionally is
  smooth in front, but is ordinarily scutellated, while behind it is smooth and generally
  compressed, except in the Alaudidae, which, having it scutellated posteriorly, are termed
  scutelliplantar, as opposed to laminiplantar (with one horny growth behind). The hallux is the
  strongest toe.</p>

  <p>Of fossil forms of Oscines, Osteornis (<i>Protornis</i>) of the Lower Eocene of Glarus in
  Switzerland may be Passerine; <i>Palaegithalus</i> (Sylviinae) and <i>Laurillardia</i> (Sturnidae)
  have been found in the French Upper Eocene; <i>Palaeospiza</i> (Fringillidae) in the Oligocene of
  Colorado; <i>Motacilla</i>, <i>Turdus</i>, <i>Lanius</i>, <i>Corvus</i>, <i>Fringilla</i>, and
  <i>Loxia</i> in the French Miocene or in the Breccia of Italy; <i>Scolephagus</i> and
  <i>Corvus</i> in the Pliocene of Oregon; <i>Palaeocorax</i> in the Chatham Islands; an extinct
  <i>Foudia</i> (Fringillidae) in R&eacute;union.</p>

  <p>Fam. I. <b>Alaudidae.</b>&ndash;The Larks inhabit the Palaearctic, Indian, and Ethiopian
  Regions, only one genus (<i>Otocorys</i>), with many races, being found in America, and one
  (<i>Mirafra</i>) in the Australian Region. Of the former, <i>O. peregrina</i>, occurs as far south
  as Bogota, while the latter is found in Australia and Flores. <i>M. hova</i> is peculiar to
  Madagascar, <i>M. javanica</i> to Borneo and Java, <i>Spizilauda</i> deva to India. <i>Alauda
  arvensis</i>, the Sky-Lark, and <i>Lullula arborea</i>, the Wood-Lark, alone breed in Britain: but
  <i>Otocorys alpestris</i>, the Shore-Lark, is a regular winter-visitor <span class="pagenum"
  id="page497"><span class="smaller">{497}</span></span>to our shores; while <i>Galerita
  cristata</i>, the Crested Lark, <i>Calandrella brachydactyla</i>, the Short-toed Lark, and
  <i>Melanocorypha sibirica</i>, the White-winged Lark, occur occasionally. The Sky-Lark has been
  introduced into Long Island, N.Y., Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The bill is long and curved in <i>Certhilauda</i> and <i>Alaemon</i>, shorter and slender in
  <i>Alauda</i>, similar but more robust in <i>Galerita</i>, abbreviated and conical in
  <i>Calandrella</i>, <i>Pyrrhulauda</i>, and <i>Melanocorypha</i>, and extraordinarily stout in
  <i>Rhamphocorys</i>, with a gap between the maxilla and mandible. The metatarsus is elongated, and
  may be more slender as in <i>Certhilauda</i>, or stouter as in <i>Galerita</i> and
  <i>Melanocorypha</i>; the hind-claw is generally much lengthened and straight, but may be short
  and curved, as in <i>Calandrella</i>, <i>Pyrrhulauda</i>, and <i>Alaemon</i>. The wing varies much
  in length, many forms having the outer primary almost aborted, though in <i>Mirafra</i> and
  elsewhere it is of fair size; the inner secondaries are nearly as long as the primaries in
  <i>Calandrella</i>. The tail is moderate or short, and may be rounded, nearly square, or
  emarginate. The normal coloration is light-brown with darker longitudinal streaks, the under parts
  being whitish and frequently spotted anteriorly; desert forms, however, often have uniform pale
  buff or rufous plumage&ndash;for example, <i>Galerita isabellina</i> and <i>Ammomanes</i>.
  <i>Melanocorypha yeltoniensis</i> is nearly black in the male; others of the same genus have a
  black gorget; the black-cheeked <i>Rhamphocorys</i>, <i>Alaemon alaudipes</i> and <i>Melanocorypha
  sibirica</i> exhibit white wing-patches; while <i>Otocorys</i> has a projecting black tuft on each
  side of the occiput, black cheeks, lores, and bands on the crown and breast, the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page498"><span class="smaller">{498}</span></span>rest of the face and throat,
  or even the lower parts, being yellowish. <i>Tephrocorys cinerea</i> and <i>Mirafra apiata</i>
  have a rufous crown and breast respectively. <i>Pyrrhulauda</i> is chiefly black below, and varies
  above from grey to chestnut, relieved by black and white. Ordinarily the sexes in Larks are
  similar. Crests are not uncommon.</p>

  <p><i>Certhilauda</i>, <i>Alaemon</i>, and <i>Ammomanes</i> inhabit deserts or arid plains,
  <i>Alaudula raytal</i> frequents sandy islets, and <i>Otocorys</i> often selects uplands; but most
  forms only require open country, being chiefly ground-birds and seldom found near woods.
  <i>Lullula</i>, however, loves heaths and the outskirts of copses, and <i>Mirafra</i> bushy spots.
  Larks often flock together, and are not usually shy, since they will even enter villages; the
  desert species are particularly quick runners, while the flight is exceptionally weak in
  <i>Ammomanes</i>, <i>Calandrella</i>, and some others, though as a rule sufficiently strong.
  Perching is not an uncommon habit, <i>Lullula</i> and <i>Mirafra</i> habitually settle on trees or
  tall bushes, and several forms squat to avoid detection. In general dusting takes the place of
  washing. The food consists of insects and their larvae, seeds, worms, small molluscs, crustaceans,
  or even berries. Most Larks soar while uttering their pleasing trills, and plaintive calls are
  often heard; <i>Lullula</i> has a more flute-like song, <i>Pyrrhulauda</i> utters a shrill chirp.
  <i>Galerita cristata</i> and <i>Melanocorypha calandra</i> imitate other birds successfully when
  caged. The cup-shaped nest of bents, lined with finer grasses, fibres, or hair, is placed in
  herbage or in some depression in the soil&ndash;wool, cotton, rags, or even sticks being
  exceptionally added; but two or three species of <i>Mirafra</i> build a domed structure,
  occasionally placed on bare rocks or roofs of houses. The eggs are generally whitish, closely
  spotted or zoned with purplish-grey or brown; some specimens, however, are thickly freckled with
  yellowish or marked with reddish. The number varies from two in <i>Pyrrhulauda</i>, and about
  three in <i>Ammomanes</i>, to five, six, or even seven. Both sexes incubate in some cases, while
  two or more broods are often reared in the season. Thousands of Sky-Larks are netted annually for
  the table.</p>

  <p>Fam. II. <b>Motacillidae.</b>&ndash;This group comprises the Sub-families <i>Motacillinae</i>,
  or Wagtails, and <i>Anthinae</i> or Pipits. The bill is thin and more or less elongated, with a
  slight notch, the culmen being decidedly curved in <i>Oreocorys</i>. The metatarsus is very long
  in Wagtails, variable but shorter in Pipits; it is usually slender, with the hind claw well
  developed and slightly <span class="pagenum" id="page499"><span
  class="smaller">{499}</span></span>curved; though it is stout, with very long hallux, in
  <i>Macronyx</i>, <i>Xanthocorys</i>, and <i>Neocorys</i>. The wing is commonly elongated and
  pointed, with the inner secondaries reaching nearly to the end of the primaries, but it is shorter
  and more rounded in some species of <i>Anthus</i>. The tail is very long in Wagtails, but moderate
  in Pipits, being generally somewhat emarginate.</p>

  <p>Wagtails range over the Old World, but are lacking in Australia and Polynesia; two species
  extend to the extreme north-west of America, one is accidental in Greenland, and one is restricted
  to Madagascar. Pipits are almost cosmopolitan, though not found in Polynesia; only two forms,
  however, inhabit North America, while one is peculiar to New Zealand, and another to Australia;
  <i>Anthus bogotensis</i> is exclusively Andean, <i>A. antarcticus</i> occurs in South Georgia,
  <i>A. bertheloti</i> occupies Madeira and the Canaries.</p>

      &times; &#x215C;. (From <i>Natural History of Selborne</i>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Wagtails are generally black and white, grey and white, grey with yellow breast (or even head),
  greenish with yellow lower <span class="pagenum" id="page500"><span
  class="smaller">{500}</span></span>parts and greyish or black heads, or almost entirely yellowish.
  Most Pipits are brown above, with dark streaks, and light edges to the feathers, and are buff,
  whitish, or rufous below, with triangular brown spots. The outer rectrices are usually more or
  less white, as are sometimes part of the others. <i>Limonidromus</i>, however, is an olive-brown
  Wagtail with two black crescentic marks below, <i>Anthus chloris</i> a Pipit with a yellow patch
  on the breast. <i>A. rosaceus</i> has yellow axillaries; <i>A. tenellus</i>, has the wings, tail,
  cheeks, and under surface chiefly yellow, with a black pectoral band. The curious genus
  <i>Macronyx</i>, to its mainly brown coloration adds orange, yellow, or pink lower parts with a
  black gorget, while it shews a marvellous resemblance in other respects to <i>Sturnella</i> (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page580">580</a></span>)&ndash;<i>M. crocea</i> to <i>S. magna</i>, <i>M.
  ameliae</i> to <i>S. defilippii</i>. The bill and feet are usually black in Wagtails; the former
  is brown, with paler mandible and yellowish gape in Pipits, where the feet are brown, yellowish,
  or reddish. The females are duller, and in the Motacillinae the young are usually browner.</p>

  <p>Wagtails frequent streams and stagnant waters, as in the case of the Pied, White, and Grey
  Wagtails, <i>Motacilla lugubris</i>, <i>M. alba</i>, and <i>M. melanope</i>; or they haunt fields
  of corn and meadows, as in the Blue-headed and Yellow Wagtails, <i>M. flava</i> and <i>M.
  raii</i>. All the above breed in Britain, but the White and Blue-headed species rarely. The Grey
  and the Yellow Wagtails both have yellow breasts, but the former has a grey, the latter an olive,
  back.</p>

  <p>Pipits prefer open places with rough herbage, as for instance the Meadow-Pipit, <i>Anthus
  pratensis</i>; rocky shores, as the Rock-Pipit, <i>A. obscurus</i>; or open parts of woods and
  banks, as the Tree-Pipit, <i>A. trivialis</i>. These nest commonly with us, while the Red-throated
  Pipit, <i>A. cervinus</i>, the Tawny Pipit, <i>A. campestris</i>, Richard's Pipit, <i>A.
  richardi</i>, and the Water-Pipit, <i>A. spipoletta</i>, visit us occasionally. Flocks are rarely
  seen, but a few individuals often congregate on the sea-beaches in winter; the flight is easy,
  though jerky, and not protracted; that of Wagtails being distinctly undulating. <i>Neocorys</i>
  soars like a Sky-Lark, and the Tree-Pipit in particular hovers above his perch while singing. The
  songs of the last-named, and of <i>Motacilla vidua</i> are more Finch-like; that of
  <i>Neocorys</i> Lark-like; those of other species shrill, and less frequent than their repeated
  call- or alarm-note of chit-chit (Pipits) or chis-sic (Wagtails). The food consists of seeds,
  insects, worms, small molluscs and crustaceans, usually procured upon the ground, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page501"><span class="smaller">{501}</span></span>Wagtails hunting for flies
  round cattle, and being very commonly seen wading. Pipits make their nests almost entirely of
  grass, <i>Anthus correndera</i> and <i>A. rufulus</i> occasionally adding an overarching cover;
  Wagtails use moss, grass, and roots, with a bedding of hair and feathers. The four to six eggs are
  bluish white or brownish, with grey, blackish, or brown spots in the Pied Wagtail and its
  similarly coloured allies, yellowish-white with yellowish and greenish-brown markings in others of
  the Sub-family; in Pipits they are commonly greyish or yellowish-white with brown and grey
  mottlings, sometimes covering the whole shell; while in the Tree-Pipit they vary from grey with
  dark brown spots and streaks to reddish-white, with rich brown, claret-colour, or bright red
  markings or close frecklings. A black line or two is a common feature throughout the Family.
  Wagtails choose for nesting sites ledges of rocks, crevices, holes in trees or walls, tops of
  pollarded willows, stony banks, or&ndash;in the Yellow Wagtail group&ndash;hollows in the soil
  among herbage. Pipits prefer the ground, or even spots shaded by trees, as in the Tree-Pipit.</p>

  <p>Fam. III. <b>Henicuridae.</b>&ndash;The Fork-tails, a group of doubtful affinity, generally
  placed near the Motacillidae, extend from the Himalayas and the hills of South and West China to
  Burma and the Great Sunda Islands, one of the species&ndash;some dozen in number&ndash;reaching
  Samarcand westwards. They are black and white birds, with stout, straight, and usually elongated
  bills, long, strong metatarsi without scutellation, moderate rounded wings, extraordinarily long
  forked and graduated tails&ndash;except in <i>Henicurus scouleri</i>, where the shape is square
  and the feathers short&ndash;and well-developed rictal bristles. The outer pair of rectrices are
  white. <i>H. ruficapilla</i> has an orange-chestnut crown and hind neck, nearly the whole back
  being chestnut in the female; that sex of <i>H. velatus</i> has a brown head; two species have the
  upper parts spotted with white, and two the back slate-coloured. Several of them have crests. The
  bill is black, the feet whitish. These active unsuspicious birds haunt forest-streams or
  hill-torrents, and hunt for molluscs, insects and their larvae, near or in the water. They often
  wag the tail when perched on stones or branches. The large nest is formed of fibres, roots, and
  moss, and is placed on rocks or tree-stumps; the three or four eggs are greenish-white, with
  scattered brownish spots.</p>

  <p>Fam. IV. <b>Timeliidae.</b>&ndash;In this Old World assemblage are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page502"><span class="smaller">{502}</span></span>included by Dr. Sharpe<a id="NtA_281"
  href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> many genera rather referable to the Turdidae, Pycnonotidae,
  Troglodytidae, and Paradiseidae; but the Family may be taken to contain most of that author's
  <i>Crateropodes</i> and <i>Timeliae</i>,<a id="NtA_282" href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a> the
  Tit-like <i>Liotriches</i>, and perhaps <i>Clitonyx</i>, <i>Chaetobias</i>, and
  <i>Myiophoneus</i>. The whole question, however, is very doubtful, and no decision can yet be
  arrived at. The supposed diagnostic points are the rounded wings curved to fit the body, the lax,
  soft plumage, the comparatively large outer primary, the similarity of the unspotted females and
  young, and the Thrush-like bill. This bill, however, may be very strong and hooked, as in
  <i>Myiophoneus</i> and <i>Gampsorhynchus</i>; stout, deep, and wide, with festooned maxilla, as in
  <i>Paradoxornis</i>; similar but smaller, as in <i>Chleuasicus</i> and <i>Suthora</i>; short and
  blunt, as in several of the <i>Liotriches</i>; extremely elongated, slender and decurved, as in
  <i>Pomatorhinus</i>; or extraordinarily so, as in <i>Xiphorhamphus</i>. It is not infrequently
  notched. The metatarsi are typically strong or even clumsy, and vary considerably in length; in
  <i>Liothrix</i>, however, they are slender; while <i>Cholornis</i> has only two anterior toes
  (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page10">10</a></span>). The tail, often broad and much graduated,
  may be very long, as in <i>Sibia</i>, or no longer than the upper coverts, as in <i>Oligura</i>;
  the rectrices being obliquely truncated in <i>Siva</i>, curved outwardly in <i>Liothrix</i>, and
  frequently pointed or somewhat spiny. Elongated rictal bristles are not uncommon; several species
  have crests, that of <i>Grammatoptila</i> being exceptionally large; rigid shafts occur in the
  head- and mantle-feathers of <i>Acanthoptila</i>, on the forehead in <i>Dumetia</i>,
  <i>Timelia</i>, and <i>Chaetops</i>; hair-like plumes decorate the back of <i>Macronus</i>; the
  inner secondaries are much produced in <i>Cinclorhamphus</i>; the cheeks are bare in
  <i>Aethocichla</i>.</p>

  <p>The sexes are commonly alike, the plain rufous coloration being often relieved by black, white,
  and grey; <i>Liothrix</i> and <i>Clitonyx</i>, however, shew tints of red or yellow;
  <i>Myiophoneus</i> of purple, blue, and black, and in some cases maroon; <i>Brachypteryx</i> of
  indigo. <i>Hyperergus</i> is partly olive-green, while <i>Trochalopterum chrysopterum</i> and
  <i>T. phoeniceum</i> exhibit respectively golden and crimson hues, not to mention other
  instances.</p>

  <p>Many of the forms are found from the Indian Region to New Guinea, New Caledonia, and New
  Britain, one reaching Fiji and two New Zealand; others occur in the Ethiopian countries, whence a
  species of <i>Argya</i> extends to Morocco and Tripoli, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page503"><span class="smaller">{503}</span></span>a second to Arabia and the Jordan.
  <i>Crossleyia</i>, <i>Bernieria</i>, <i>Mystacornis</i>, <i>Xanthomixis</i> and <i>Oxylabes</i>
  are peculiar to Madagascar.</p>

  <p>Most members of the Family inhabit woods near water with thick undergrowth, or more rarely
  stony hills, scrubby gullies, and rocky torrents; <i>Cinclorhamphus</i> haunts grassy plains;
  <i>Crateropus kirki</i> prefers reeds. The majority are decidedly terrestrial, skulking warily
  among the bushes and grass, either singly or in small companies, while some are inquisitive and
  active. The flight is low, short, undulating, and laboured; but the birds hop and climb well,
  bounding over the ground or clinging to the trees. The Japanese and Chinese "Hill-Robin"
  (<i>Liothrix lutea</i>) and its allies are more arboreal, as are <i>Paradoxornis</i>,
  <i>Suthora</i>, and so forth. <i>Orthonyx</i> is said to dance like a Lyre-bird (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page493">493</a></span>). Many species scratch up the soil or dead leaves
  in search of insects and their larvae, which, with seeds, constitute the chief food; fruit,
  however, or even small reptiles, crabs, worms, and molluscs are occasionally eaten. The tail is
  often carried erect; <i>Cinclosoma</i> rises with a whirring noise; <i>Cinclorhamphus</i> hovers
  in the air. Several members of the Family are comparatively silent, <i>Sittiparus</i> and
  <i>Alcippe</i> twitter, <i>Stachyridopsis</i> utters clear, bell-like tones, <i>Timelia</i> slowly
  repeated cries, <i>Myiophoneus</i> a fine whistle; but usually harsh chattering or screaming
  noises alternate with chuckles, croaks, clucks, or a laughing chorus. <i>Psophodes</i> is called
  the "Coach-whip bird," from its notes ending like the crack of a whip. The habits of
  <i>Clitonyx</i> are said to resemble those of the Meliphagidae. The nest is commonly a rough
  structure of leaves, moss, herbage, and the like, often lined with roots, which is placed in low
  trees, bushes, reeds, grass, holes in trees, or banks, by <i>Garrulax</i>, <i>Argya</i>, and
  <i>Turdinus</i>; in crevices of rocks, by <i>Chaetops</i>; or on crags near torrents, by
  <i>Myiophoneus</i>. It may consist of somewhat softer <span class="pagenum" id="page504"><span
  class="smaller">{504}</span></span>materials, frequently bedded with fur, wool, or feathers, as in
  <i>Crateropus</i>, <i>Paradoxornis</i>, and <i>Trochalopterum</i>&ndash;several pairs of the
  last-named occasionally using the same tree; or it may be a domed mass of grass, leaves, bark, and
  moss, situated on or near the ground, as in <i>Timelia</i>, <i>Orthonyx</i>, <i>Pomatorhinus</i>,
  <i>Pellorneum</i>, and <i>Rhopocichla</i>. <i>Lioptila</i> and some of its nearest allies build a
  mossy cup, adorned with cobwebs, in high firs or other trees. The eggs of <i>Crateropus</i> and
  <i>Argya</i> are deep greenish-blue, glossy and spotless; those of <i>Garrulax</i> are similar, or
  pale blue or white; those of <i>Dryonastes</i> light blue; those of <i>Pomatorhinus</i>,
  <i>Stachyris</i>, <i>Orthonyx</i>, and <i>Xiphorhamphus</i> white; those of <i>Paradoxornis</i>
  whitish, with yellow-brown and purple markings. The ground-colour is frequently greenish-blue,
  olive, brown, salmon, creamy, or white, and shews scattered or dense spots, streaks, freckles,
  blotches, or even hieroglyphics, of reddish, purplish, chocolate, olive, grey, or occasionally
  black. The coloration, however, is by no means constant in each genus, while the number varies
  from two to five or six. The Australian Pomatorhini fashion large domed nests, after the manner of
  Magpies, of twigs lined with bark and feathers, and add a spout-like entrance, while several are
  commonly found at the ends of the branches of the same tree; their buff or purplish eggs, clouded
  with brown and purple, and streaked with black hair-lines, number from four to ten.</p>

  <p>Fam. V. <b>Pycnonotidae.</b>&ndash;The Bulbuls, often included among the Timeliidae, have a
  fairly long bill, usually somewhat stout and curved, which is Finch-like in <i>Spizixus</i>, very
  long and thin in <i>Phyllostrephus</i>, and so forth. The maxilla is generally notched, being
  minutely serrated in <i>Andropadus</i>, and decidedly hooked in <i>Tricholestes</i>,
  <i>Aethorhynchus</i>, and <i>Trichophoropsis</i>; while strong or weak rictal bristles are
  ordinarily present. The abbreviated metatarsi lack scales in several genera. The wings are
  normally short, rounded, and concave&ndash;though more pointed in <i>Hypsipetes</i> and
  <i>Irena</i> (if these really belong to the Family), <i>Hemixus</i>, <i>Alcurus</i>, and
  <i>Ixocincla</i> or even long in <i>Tylas</i>&ndash;the secondaries are much elongated in
  <i>Aethorhynchus</i>. The tail is sometimes square or graduated, but is commonly rounded, being
  rarely forked, as in <i>Hypsipetes</i>; in <i>Irena</i> and <i>Micropus</i> the coverts are much
  lengthened, while they nearly equal the rectrices in <i>I. crinigera</i>. Crests occur frequently,
  the constituent feathers in <i>Alcurus</i> being obtuse, in <i>Criniger</i> long and pointed, in
  <i>Otocompsa</i> somewhat recurved. <span class="pagenum" id="page505"><span
  class="smaller">{505}</span></span>Most of the Family are characterized by long, fluffy
  rump-plumage and conspicuous nuchal or dorsal hairs, the latter reaching their highest development
  in <i>Tricholestes</i>. The feathers hide the nostrils in <i>Irena</i> and <i>Spizixus</i>;
  <i>Poliolophus</i> has a yellow circumocular wattle, and several species of <i>Pycnonotus</i>
  possess fleshy eyelids of black, red, or grey.</p>

  <p>The usual coloration is olive-brown, olive-green, or olive-yellow, commonly with wholly or
  partially yellow, white, greyish, or even orange, rufous, and buff under parts; <i>Hypsipetes
  perniger</i> is entirely black, <i>Micropus melanoleucus</i> black with white wing-spots, and many
  species are mottled with yellowish or white. <i>Trachycomus</i> has a yellow cap of decomposed
  bristly feathers; while elsewhere the head or the throat is often more or less black, brown,
  chestnut, grey, and rarely yellow or white. The tail and rump may be rufous, yellow, or orange,
  occasionally barred with black; and white or yellow markings frequently adorn the wings.
  <i>Otocompsa</i> shews crimson or scarlet ear-tufts, and crimson or yellow under tail-coverts;
  certain species of <i>Pycnonotus</i> have the latter scarlet, orange, or yellow; <i>Rubigula</i>
  has loose, stiff, scarlet plumage on the throat, and an orange under surface. <i>Chloropsis</i> is
  green and yellow, relieved by orange, blue, purple and black, and exhibits a conspicuous blue,
  purple, or emerald shoulder-patch, except in <i>C. cyanopogon</i> and <i>C. flavipennis</i>;
  <i>Aegithina</i> and <i>Aethorhynchus</i> are green, black, and yellow; while <i>Irena</i> (the
  Fairy Blue-bird) is either brilliant turquoise, with black wings, tail, and under parts, or
  purple-blue, varied by cobalt above, with or without a black mantle and under surface. The bill
  and legs range from brown, black, or plumbeous, to coral red, orange, yellow, or whitish. The
  sexes are similar, except in <i>Aegithina</i>, <i>Aethorhynchus</i>, <i>Chloropsis</i>, and
  <i>Irena</i>.</p>

  <p>From their headquarters in the Indian and Indo-Malay countries, the Pycnonotidae extend to
  China, Hainan, Formosa, and the Moluccas, <i>Hypsipetes</i> even reaching Japan; they also occupy
  the whole Ethiopian Region, with Madagascar and the neighbouring islands. To these latter
  <i>Ixocincla</i> and <i>Tylas</i> (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page533">533</a></span>) are
  peculiar; while <i>Pycnonotus</i>, <i>Criniger</i> and <i>Xenocichla</i> inhabit both of the above
  Regions, and the first is found from Morocco to the Cyclades, Rhodes, Cyprus, and Palestine.</p>

  <p>Bulbuls are gregarious arboreal birds of feeble flight, rarely seen upon the ground, where they
  move with awkward shuffles or short hops. The majority are sociable, and frequent gardens, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page506"><span class="smaller">{506}</span></span>orchards, forests, and low
  jungles; they feed chiefly upon fruits, including berries and seeds, but also upon insects, which
  <i>Aethorhynchus</i>, <i>Aegithina</i>, and <i>Chloropsis</i> in especial seek among the leaves
  and branches of the trees. The ordinary note is a mellow cheerful whistle, becoming a pretty song
  in such species as <i>Pycnonotus haemorrhous</i>, and <i>P. xanthopygus</i>, the Ceylon and
  Palestine Nightingales; chattering and chirping sounds are, however, often heard, while
  <i>Criniger</i>, <i>Phyllostrephus</i> and <i>Hypsipetes</i> habitually utter reiterated jarring
  or croaking cries, particularly when roosting in company. The flimsy, or occasionally bulky, nests
  of twigs, fibres, grass, moss, and cobwebs are placed in low trees, bushes, creepers, or
  bamboo-clumps; <i>Aegithina</i>, <i>Chloropsis</i>, and <i>Irena</i> generally laying two or three
  white or greenish eggs with brown streaks or spots, and the remaining forms from two to four, of a
  pinkish white or salmon colour, with markings of various reds and purples. The nest of <i>Iole</i>
  is suspended by the rim like that of an Oriole. The Perso-Arabic Bulbul of poets is probably
  <i>Daulias hafizi</i>, a true Nightingale.</p>

  <p>Fam. VI. <b>Muscicapidae.</b>&ndash;The Old World Flycatchers are a group of somewhat vague
  definition, <i>Hemipus</i> appearing closely allied to the <i>Laniidae</i>, <i>Cryptolopha</i> to
  the <i>Sylviinae</i>, <i>Lioptilus</i> to the <i>Timeliidae</i>. Connexion with the
  <i>Turdinae</i> is implied by the more or less spotted plumage of the young, though the metatarsus
  is usually scutellated anteriorly. Typically the bill is broad and flat, with stiff rictal and
  prominent nasal bristles; it is extremely wide, with the culminal ridge strongly developed in
  <i>Machaerorhynchus</i>, <i>Myiagra</i>, <i>Bias</i>, and <i>Smithornis</i>; <i>Sisura</i> has it
  longer and more slender; <i>Chelidorhynx</i> short, with a pronounced hook; and the diminutive
  <i>Smicrornis</i> exceptionally small; while many species have it much less robust. The feet,
  usually weak, may be stronger, as in <i>Chloropeta</i>; the wings, ordinarily elongated and
  pointed, and especially so in <i>Hemichelidon</i>, are at times abbreviated and rounded, as in
  <i>Niltava</i>, whereas the secondaries in <i>Platystira</i> and <i>Newtonia</i> nearly equal the
  primaries, of which the outer is very short. The tail is also short in <i>Diaphorophyia</i>, but
  is usually moderate or long, and frequently much graduated, as in <i>Rhipidura</i> (Fantail),
  <i>Elminia</i>, and <i>Terpsiphone</i>, the males of the last having the two median feathers twice
  the length of the body. <i>Terpsiphone</i>, <i>Cyanomyias</i>, <i>Bias</i>, <i>Trochocercus</i>,
  and so forth, have fine crests, shorter in the female; while fleshy wattles, round or <span
  class="pagenum" id="page507"><span class="smaller">{507}</span></span>above the eye, of scarlet,
  blue, or yellow, are found in <i>Terpsiphone</i>, <i>Zeocephus</i>, <i>Diaphorophyia</i>,
  <i>Platystira</i>, and <i>Arses</i>. The bill is sometimes reddish or blue, and the inside of the
  mouth green or yellow, as in certain Birds of Paradise.</p>

  <p>The males of our summer visitors, the Spotted and Pied Flycatchers, <i>Muscicapa grisola</i>
  and <i>M. atricapilla</i>, are respectively brown with whitish under parts streaked with dusky,
  and black and white; the hen-bird being similar in the former case, but in the latter olive-brown,
  with the frontlet, wing-patches, and lower surface buff instead of white. <i>M.</i>
  (<i>Erythrosterna</i>) <i>parva</i>, which is brown with grey head, and has a reddish-orange
  fore-neck that becomes rufous in the female, occurs accidentally in Britain. <i>Platystira</i> is
  glossy bluish- or greenish-black above with white markings, and white beneath with a black
  pectoral band, the female having greyer upper parts, and sometimes a maroon chest;
  <i>Erythromyias</i> is black and white, with an orange-rufous breast or back;
  <i>Pseudogerygone</i> is olive-green, brown, or grey above&ndash;dark crimson in <i>P.
  rubra</i>&ndash;with an admixture of black, buff, rufous, yellow, or white, and has similar or
  yellow tints below; <i>Chasiempis</i> is brownish, relieved by black, white, and bay;
  <i>Culicicapa</i> is greenish-yellow with a bright yellow lower surface, the head being grey in
  one species. The hen-bird in these four genera, where known, resembles the male. That sex of
  <i>Niltava</i> is blackish or purplish, varied with rich cobalt, especially on the neck, the under
  parts being orange-rufous or purplish-grey; the female is chiefly olive, often with a blue or
  lilac neck-patch. <i>Malurus</i> commonly shews a fine mixture of blue, purple, and velvety-black,
  with a little brown and white; one of its members is chiefly brown, but has a blue tail, and a
  lilac crown with black centre; a second is vermilion, black and brown above, and black below; a
  third has crimson in the place of vermilion; a fourth is bluish-black and white. The hen-birds are
  mainly brown, often with a blue, or even a green, tail. <i>Piezorhynchus</i> has two metallic
  black species, while <i>P. chrysomelas</i> is orange-yellow and black; <i>Metabolus</i> is almost
  white, with black face and throat; and lastly, <i>Terpsiphone</i> (or <i>Tchitrea</i>), well known
  on Chinese and Japanese screens and fans, contains several long-tailed and finely crested white
  birds, with glossy greenish-black head and throat, and with black markings on the wings and tail
  in <i>T. paradisi</i>, the Paradise-Flycatcher. The female is rich bay above, with similar head,
  but grey cheeks and throat. In <span class="pagenum" id="page508"><span
  class="smaller">{508}</span></span>other species the males are said to be maroon, cinnamon,
  chestnut, blue-grey, or glossy-black above. <i>T. mutata</i> of Madagascar may be dimorphic.
  Nuchal collars, elongated silky flank-feathers, and spots or stripes below, are not infrequent in
  the Family.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Flycatchers are common in the Ethiopian, Indian, and Australian Regions; and several species
  are Palaearctic, four or five reaching Europe. Most of them are migratory, the Spotted Flycatcher
  nesting northwards to Troms&ouml; and Archangel, the Pied Flycatcher nearly as far. They love wooded
  districts, and <i>Gerygone</i> even gloomy forests; while they are usually silent and solitary,
  feeding on little but insects, which are habitually caught upon the wing with an audible snap of
  the bill, though also procured upon the boughs or by darting to the ground. The graceful,
  undulating, or zigzag flight, and the sudden dash into the air, followed by a quick return to the
  perch, are especially characteristic, as is a frequent quivering of the wings and tail;
  <i>Rhipidura motacillo&iuml;des</i> is Wagtail-like in habits; while <i>Sisura inquieta</i>, the
  "Grinder" of Australia, runs along the river-sides, or hovers like a Kestrel, making a grinding
  sound in the air, whence it descends vertically to secure its prey. Other species of
  <i>Rhipidura</i> pick flies off cattle, and rise and fall perpendicularly in the air, opening the
  fan-shaped tail or tumbling completely over. <i>Malurus</i> runs quickly, or bounds along with
  rapid hops. Most Flycatchers are tame, but several are pugnacious; <i>Lanioturdus</i> is stated to
  be gregarious; <i>Parisoma</i> creeps about thick bushes; <span class="pagenum" id="page509"><span
  class="smaller">{509}</span></span><i>Smicrornis</i> clings to the branches like a Tit;
  <i>Niltava</i> and other forms eat berries and the like in late summer; <i>Eopsaltria</i> and
  <i>Gerygone</i> are very fond of insect-larvae. The voice is usually faint, but is harsh in
  <i>Terpsiphone</i>, <i>Smithornis</i>, and <i>Batis</i>, croaking in <i>Piezorhynchus</i> and
  <i>Lanioturdus</i>; <i>Sisura</i> whistles; <i>Gerygone</i>, <i>Malurus</i>, and our Pied
  Flycatcher, have pleasing Redstart-like songs; while that of <i>Microeca</i>, which often soars
  aloft when singing, is said to resemble the strain of the Chaffinch. The neat nest, usually formed
  of grass, moss, leaves, bark, fibres, or hair, and not infrequently decorated with lichens or
  cobwebs, is placed in low forks or cavities of trees, if not among creepers or outgrowths on
  banks, <i>Terpsiphone</i> preferring higher situations. <i>Gerygone</i> builds a covered
  pear-shaped structure, with or without a protecting porch, of like materials, lined with fur or
  feathers, and suspends it in shrubs; <i>Malurus</i> and <i>Smicrornis</i> make rounder fabrics;
  while that of <i>Ochromela</i> is somewhat similar, but is composed of grass and ferns, and
  usually placed in low vegetation. The eggs, in number from two to six, are greenish- or
  buffish-white, with red, brown, or rarely grey, spots and blotches; exceptionally they are uniform
  light blue, as in <i>Muscicapa atricapilla</i>; white, as in <i>Chelidorhynx</i>; apple-green,
  green-blue, or whitish, with reddish-brown, yellowish, or lilac markings, as in <i>Eopsaltria</i>;
  or white, with red or purplish spots, as in <i>Malurus</i>, <i>Chasiempis</i>, and
  <i>Gerygone</i>.</p>

  <p>Fam. VII. <b>Turdidae.</b>&ndash;This group is here divided into five Sub-families, (1)
  <i>Turdinae</i> or Thrushes and their allies; (2) <i>Myiodectinae</i>; (3) <i>Sylviinae</i> or
  Warblers; (4) <i>Polioptilinae</i>; and (5) <i>Miminae</i> or Mocking-birds. The first and third
  of these are often considered separate Families, but they are so closely connected by the
  Saxicoline and Ruticilline forms that they can hardly lay claim to such rank, while the
  <i>Accentorinae</i> and <i>Regulinae</i> of certain authors seem unnecessary. The <i>Miminae</i>
  shew some affinity to the Wrens (<i>Troglodytidae</i>).</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Turdinae.</i>&ndash;In this section the bill is usually rather long and stout,
  being notched but hardly curved, with few, if any, basal bristles; it is somewhat hooked in the
  so-called genus <i>Geocichla</i>&ndash;where it is much lengthened in five species, and
  abbreviated in <i>G. princii</i>; large, broad, and arched in <i>Turnagra</i> (a doubtful member
  of the Family); comparatively short and slender in <i>Sialia</i>, <i>Ruticilla</i>,
  <i>Erithacus</i>, <i>Saxicola</i>, and so forth; more robust in <i>Accentor</i>. The metatarsus is
  long in <i>Catharus</i>, <i>Calliope</i>, and <i>Notodela</i>, but <span class="pagenum"
  id="page510"><span class="smaller">{510}</span></span>is usually moderate, being particularly
  strong in <i>Geocichla</i>, <i>Nesocichla</i>, <i>Zoothera</i>, and <i>Turnagra</i>; in
  <i>Saxicola</i>, <i>Erithacus</i>, and <i>Daulias</i> it is at once slender and elongated.
  Generally the anterior scales are fused together, forming an ocreated covering (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page10">10</a></span>), but the opposite sometimes occurs, as in
  <i>Accentor</i>, <i>Nesocichla</i>, and <i>Thamnobia</i>. Typically the wing is fairly long and
  broad, with abbreviated outer primary, the next feather being emarginated in some species of
  <i>Myrmecocichla</i>; but in Dr. Sharpe's group Thamnobiae,<a id="NtA_283"
  href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> it is generally abbreviated and more rounded, in <i>Sialia</i>
  it is pointed. The tail may be long and wide, as in <i>Turnagra</i>, or comparatively short, as in
  <i>Monticola</i> and <i>Pratincola</i>, but is usually of medium length; it is normally square or
  rounded, though emarginated in <i>Sialia</i>, and much graduated in <i>Copsychus</i> and
  <i>Cittocincla</i>, while in <i>Cossypha natalensis</i> it has pointed feathers. <i>Turdus</i>
  (<i>Geocichla</i>) <i>varius</i>, <i>T. horsfieldi</i>, and <i>T. hancii</i> have fourteen
  rectrices.</p>

  <p>The coloration is ordinarily plain black or brown, more or less varied with grey, white,
  rufous, or chestnut, occasionally in the form of a collar; many Thrushes, moreover, exhibit the
  characteristic white breast spotted with brown. The bill is frequently orange or yellow. As
  examples of the genus <i>Turdus</i> we may take our native Blackbird, Mistletoe- and Song-Thrushes
  <i>T. merula</i>, <i>T. viscivorus</i>, and <i>T. musicus</i>; our summer visitor the Ring-Ousel,
  <i>T. torquatus</i>; our winter immigrants the Redwing and Fieldfare, <i>T. iliacus</i> and <i>T.
  pilaris</i>; the American "Robin," <i>T. migratorius</i>; and the Ground-Thrushes
  ("<i>Geocichla</i>,") with their light patch under the wing. The sexes are commonly alike, but
  black or grey males have usually brownish females. A bushy crest occurs in <i>Catharus</i>.</p>

  <p>Of some ten Rock-Thrushes (<i>Monticola</i>), <i>M. saxatilis</i> occurs exceptionally in
  Britain. It has a cobalt and blackish-blue head, neck, and upper back, a nearly white mid-back,
  brown remiges, chestnut lateral rectrices and lower surface. <i>M. cyanus</i> is almost entirely
  blue. The browner hens are generally spotted and barred below. <i>Cochoa viridis</i> is green and
  black, with blue-green under parts, and blue on the head, tail, and wings; <i>C. purpurea</i> has
  the bright colours replaced by purplish-brown and lavender; <i>C. azurea</i> is mainly rich blue,
  becoming purple below. The females are duller. Blue-birds (<i>Sialia</i>) are bright blue, often
  with chestnut breast or back, the males being the most brilliant; <i>Grandala caelicolor</i> is
  indigo, with blackish wings and tail.</p>

  <p>In <i>Saxicola</i> (Wheatear) the rump-region is white, except in some seven species, where it
  is entirely or partly chestnut or buff; the plumage exhibits various combinations of jet black,
  chestnut, brown, grey, and white, the black shewing especially upon the breast, quill-feathers,
  throat, lores, or ear-coverts. The females may be similar to the males or browner. <i>Pratincola
  rubetra</i>, our Whinchat, is mottled with brown and buff above and is buff below, having a
  superciliary streak and wing-bar of whitish; <i>P. rubicola</i>, the Stonechat, is blacker on the
  back, and has the head and throat black, but the breast rufous, while the hen lacks the black
  head. Other species have white rumps or tails, and the breast or even most of the plumage black.
  <i>Oreicola</i> has three black members with white under parts; <i>Myrmecocichla</i> eight, which
  are grey or brown, relieved by black, white, and buff. The Australian and Pacific Robins
  (<i>Petroeca</i>), of very doubtful affinity, are blackish or greyish, with scarlet or pink
  breasts, and some white above; one having a red head. Our Redstart, <i>Ruticilla phoenicurus</i>,
  is grey, with brown wings, chestnut breast, rump, and lateral rectrices, black face and throat;
  the hen being brownish above and buff below, with less brilliant chestnut tints. The Black
  Redstart is dark grey, with brighter rufous rump and tail, black lower parts, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page512"><span class="smaller">{512}</span></span>and a white wing-patch;
  brown replacing the grey and black in the female. Some species are blacker above, one has a
  chestnut back and no black throat, another has both rump and tail black, and three have blue on
  the forehead and crown, one of these again having a white gular mark. <i>R. moussieri</i>, linking
  the Redstarts to the Chats, is black, with orange-rufous rump, tail, and lower surface, a white
  alar spot, and white extending from the forehead to the face. The Robin,<a id="NtA_284"
  href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a> <i>Erithacus rubecula</i>, needs no description; the Persian
  <i>E. hyrcanus</i> hardly differs; the similar Japanese Robin, <i>E. akahige</i>, has a grey
  belly; the Corean <i>E. komadori</i> is orange-chestnut above, black and white beneath. The
  Blue-throat, <i>Cyanecula suecica</i>, is brown, except for a white superciliary streak, bay
  tail-coverts, and a bright blue throat with a central rufous spot, to which succeed black, white,
  and rusty bands, and a whitish belly. <i>C. wolfi</i> lacks the gular spot, <i>C. leucocyana</i>
  has it white. <i>Calliope camtschatcensis</i>, <i>C. pectoralis</i>, and <i>C. tschebaiewi</i>,
  are brown or dark grey, with grey or black breasts, white abdomens, some black and white on the
  face, and glossy scarlet throats. <i>Daulias luscinia</i>, our summer visitor the Nightingale, and
  the larger eastern <i>D. philomela</i> are russet-brown in both sexes, with redder rump and tail,
  and whitish lower parts. <i>D. hafizi</i> of Persia is intermediate (<i>cf.</i> <span

  <p>Our Hedge-sparrow, <i>Accentor modularis</i>, is brown streaked with blackish, and shews
  bluish-grey on the head, throat, and breast; but the Alpine Accentor, <i>A. collaris</i>, which
  rarely visits Britain, has a white throat spotted with black, and flanks mottled with chestnut;
  while their congeners exhibit rufous lower parts or pectoral bands, black throats, or whiter wings
  and tails. <i>Ephthianura</i> is grey, brown, black and white above, with the crown, rump, and
  breast crimson in one species and yellow in two; <span class="pagenum" id="page513"><span
  class="smaller">{513}</span></span>of the latter one has a black mark on the breast, as has a
  fourth form with a white lower surface.</p>

  <p>In the Thamnobiae the sexes are alike, or the females duller. The colour, as in <i>Callene</i>
  and <i>Copsychus</i>, may be dull blue and cobalt, purplish- or bluish-black, or bluish-grey,
  often with white rump; or, as in <i>Cossypha</i> and <i>Thamnobia</i>, grey, brown or blackish,
  with orange-chestnut or rufous rump, tail, and abdomen. Stripes of black and white often adorn the
  face, the ruddy hue occasionally tinges the breast, nape, or wing, while a blue alar patch or a
  white head occur exceptionally. <i>Cittocincla</i> is intermediate in coloration; <i>Alethe</i> is
  chiefly chestnut or rufescent-olive above, but grey and white or creamy buff below, with orange
  crown in two cases. <i>Turnagra</i> has brown upper parts with reddish tail, and the lower surface
  either grey with white throat, or whitish with dusky stripes; <i>Cichladusa</i> is similar, or has
  buff under parts, with black spots and gular crescent. All the above frequently exhibit white on
  the wings or tail. <i>Lamprolia</i> is velvety-black, with blue spangles on the head and neck, and
  white rump-region; <i>Tarsiger</i> is either blue above, varied with black, white, olive, or
  yellow, and with more or less orange below, or lacks the blue entirely. <i>Aedonopsis</i> and
  <i>Phaeornis</i> are brown, with grey and white under parts.</p>

  <p>In the Turdinae the young are constantly spotted, as opposed to the Sylviinae.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Myiodectinae.</i>&ndash;These birds differ from the <i>Turdinae</i> in their
  short, somewhat depressed bills, and strong rictal bristles. <i>Myiodectes</i> and
  <i>Cichlopsis</i> are in both sexes fairly uniform brown, grey, or blackish, with a grey lower
  surface, and occasionally chestnut or orange throat and belly; one species of the former, however,
  is cinnamon, with black head and under parts, and a white band across the cheeks.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Sylviinae.</i>&ndash;Besides the typical Warblers are here included most of Dr.
  Sharpe's groups <i>Bradypteri</i> and <i>Cisticolae</i>,<a id="NtA_285"
  href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> but not, of course, the American "Warblers"
  (<i>Mniotiltidae</i>). They differ from the Turdinae in being smaller, with the bill usually weak
  and slender, though it is very stout in <i>Rhopophilus</i> and <i>Arundinax</i>; a few genera shew
  strong rictal hairs; while <i>Regulus</i> has the nostrils covered by one or more peculiar bristly
  feathers. The metatarsus is sometimes scutellated anteriorly; the wings are comparatively <span
  class="pagenum" id="page514"><span class="smaller">{514}</span></span>short and broad. The tail,
  which in some twenty genera contains but ten feathers, varies from square to rounded, being rarely
  emarginated, but not uncommonly graduated, as in <i>Locustella</i>, <i>Cisticola</i>, and
  elsewhere; it is much lengthened and widened in <i>Laticilla</i>, broad and soft in
  <i>Bradypterus</i>, and so forth. In <i>Sphenoeacus</i>, <i>Dromaeocercus</i>, and the still
  longer-tailed <i>Stipiturus</i> the rectrices are spiny with curiously decomposed webs; in
  <i>Orthotomus</i> the median pair are elongated during summer in the male; in <i>Sylviella</i> the
  rump-feathers nearly hide the tail itself.</p>

  <p>The usual coloration in both sexes is plain greyish or brown, with rufous, buff, white, or
  yellowish lower parts, and frequently spots, stripes, and streaks. Many forms, however, shew more
  or less black or red hues, often in the form of a cap; others, as <i>Cryptolopha</i>,
  <i>Habrornis</i>, <i>Tickellia</i>, and <i>Phyllergates</i> exhibit brilliant yellows and greens,
  relieved by grey, black, chestnut, and white; <i>Orthotomus</i> and some species of <i>Prinia</i>,
  <i>Hapalis</i>, and <i>Euprinodes</i> are hardly duller; while <i>Phylloscopus</i>,
  <i>Acanthopneuste</i>, <i>Regulus</i>, <i>Hypolais</i>, <i>Neornis</i>, and <i>Acanthiza</i> vary
  from yellow-green to brown and buff above. <i>Regulus</i>, <i>Phyllergates</i>, and certain
  members of <i>Cisticola</i>, have red, orange, or yellow crowns; <i>Acanthiza</i> has scaly
  frontal feathers; the male of <i>Stipiturus</i> a blue throat; <i>Myiomoira</i> is black and
  white, with a yellow and orange breast in one case; <i>Stiphrornis</i> has an orange throat in
  two; <i>Leptopoecile</i> shews a blue wash on the rump and lower surface.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 4. <i>Polioptilinae.</i>&ndash;The Gnatcatchers, with the sole genus
  <i>Polioptila</i>, have very slender bills, moderate rictal bristles, metatarsi scutellated
  anteriorly, shortish wings, and graduated tails. They are blue-grey above, with black rectrices,
  externally marked with white; and are greyish or white below. White shews occasionally on the
  wing, and some males have black heads.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 5. <i>Miminae.</i>&ndash;The American Mocking-birds have fairly long bills, which are
  little decurved except in <i>Harporhynchus</i>, but are frequently notched, and bristly at the
  gape. The metatarsi are usually strong and distinctly scutellated in front, though more slender in
  <i>Oreoscoptes</i> and <i>Melanoptila</i>, and sometimes quite smooth in the latter and
  <i>Galeoscoptes</i>; the wings are shortish and rounded, with well-developed outer primary; the
  tail is rather long and is generally broad and much graduated, but is narrower and squarer in
  <i>Oreoscoptes</i>. The usual coloration is dull brown, rufous, and grey, varied by white on the
  remiges and rectrices, and by an occasional <span class="pagenum" id="page515"><span
  class="smaller">{515}</span></span>black cap or chestnut vent; <i>Melanoptila</i>, however, is
  uniform purplish- or bluish-black, <i>Rhodinocincla</i> rosy or rufous below in the male and
  female respectively, with superciliary streak to match. <i>Oreoscoptes</i>, <i>Mimus</i>,
  <i>Cichlherminia</i>, and <i>Harporhynchus</i> often shew spots beneath and <i>Donacobius</i>
  dusky bars, <i>Mimus trifasciatus</i> has a dark chest-band.</p>

  <p>The Turdidae occupy the whole globe, being characteristically, though not invariably,
  migratory.<a id="NtA_286" href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> Of the Turdinae, Thrushes abound in
  the Neotropical Region, and&ndash;if we include the Ground-Thrushes&ndash;are common in the
  Ethiopian, Indian, and Australian, but the Palaearctic and Nearctic are poorly supplied: Chats,
  Robins, Redstarts, Nightingales, Hedge-sparrows, and their nearest allies are mainly Palaearctic,
  Ethiopian, and Indian; though <i>Sialia</i> reaches America, <i>Pratincola</i> Celebes, and
  <i>Petroeca</i> Samoa. <i>Nesocichla</i> is restricted to Tristan da Cunha, <i>Turnagra</i> to New
  Zealand, <i>Phaeornis</i> to the Sandwich Islands; while Madagascar possesses peculiar forms both
  of this Sub-family and of the Sylviinae. The last-named, however, are chiefly Palaearctic, and
  visit the southern Old World in winter; yet two species of <i>Acrocephalus</i> breed in Australia,
  <i>Miro</i> and <i>Myiomoira</i> occupy New Zealand, <i>Tatare</i> and <i>Psamathia</i> are
  Polynesian, one species of <i>Phylloscopus</i> reaches Alaska, <i>Regulus</i> occurs thence to
  Panama, and so forth. The Polioptilinae and Miminae inhabit North and South America; the
  Myiodectinae range from the more western United States to Bolivia and Brazil. Of the last groups
  several forms are confined to the Antilles, and of the Miminae three to the Gal&aacute;pagos.</p>

  <p>Thrushes inhabit wooded country, and reach an altitude of twenty thousand feet in some
  latitudes; they feed chiefly on the ground, where they hop about scratching or searching for
  worms, molluscs, and insects. Snails are habitually cracked on some favourite stone by the
  Song-Thrush, and fruit is also eaten. The strong rapid flight is undulating and frequently low,
  but flocks cover vast distances on migration; Ground-Thrushes are naturally more terrestrial and
  resident, while the solitary Rock-Thrushes haunt stony hills, rocks, and ruins. This Sub-family
  comprises some of our very finest songsters, the Song-Thrush or Mavis vying with the Nightingale,
  which gladdens both day and night, and the Blackbird uttering delightfully mellow notes; but
  chirping sounds and harsher screams are common. <i>Phaeornis</i> <span class="pagenum"
  id="page516"><span class="smaller">{516}</span></span>sings prettily. The typical Turdine nest is
  a massive cup of grass, cemented with mud and inlaid with finer herbage; but other materials are
  constantly added, while mud, dung, or rotten wood constitutes the lining in the case of the
  Song-Thrush, and occasionally elsewhere. It is usually placed in trees or bushes, but not
  infrequently in cavities in trunks, walls or rocks, and sometimes on the ground in heather, banks,
  and so forth. The eggs may be greenish or bluish with reddish-brown or purplish spots and streaks,
  or glossy blue with or without black or brown markings; Rock-Thrushes have them light blue with
  faint stains, or pinkish with rusty freckles, <i>Turnagra</i> whitish with black-brown spots.</p>

  <p>As regards the Saxicoline and Ruticilline forms attention should be drawn to the jerky,
  flitting flight, the "chacking" alarm-note and the rarer song of our Wheatear, the similar habits
  of our Stonechat and Whinchat, not to mention other allied forms; as well as to the pleasant notes
  of Redstarts, Redbreasts, Blue-throats, and Hedge-sparrows, and the common habits of hopping,
  flirting the tail, and drooping the wings. The nests of Chats consist of grass and moss, often
  lined with hair, feathers, or fur, and are usually placed in holes of various descriptions, or in
  rough herbage; the four to seven blue, greenish, or even whitish eggs being spotted or zoned with
  rufous, except in a few instances, such as our Wheatear, where markings are rare. Deserts and
  stony or furzy flats are favourite haunts. <i>Petroeca</i> adds bark, fibres, cobwebs, or lichens,
  and chooses sites in forks, or holes in trees and walls; the greenish or buffish eggs being marked
  with purplish, brown and grey. <i>Cyanecula</i> and <i>Nemura</i> select hollows in marshy spots,
  building with moss, grass, and leaves, like Robins; but the former, instead of reddish-white eggs
  with rufous spots, has them olive-coloured or dull greenish with faint rusty markings, as have the
  Nightingales, which place their fabric of oak or beech leaves on the ground or in low shrubs.
  <i>Copsychus</i>, <i>Cossypha</i>, <i>Catharus</i>, and <i>Thamnobia</i> nest as Robins do, in
  holes in banks, trees, or walls, and have similar eggs; Redstarts deposit five or six, which are
  light blue or white and very rarely spotted, in a structure of grass, moss, roots, hair, and
  feathers, placed in cavities of trees or masonry; <i>Tarsiger</i> and <i>Notodela</i> prefer
  hollows in banks and rocks, and lay blue and salmon-pink eggs respectively. <i>Hodgsonius</i> and
  <i>Larvivora</i> also have them blue. <i>Chimarrhornis</i> and <i>Rhyacornis</i> nidificate like
  Redstarts, but their eggs are greenish-white with rufous or yellowish spots; the shy <span
  class="pagenum" id="page517"><span class="smaller">{517}</span></span><i>Cittocincla</i> haunts
  thick woods, and deposits four oily-green eggs, with brown and purplish spots and dashes, on a bed
  of leaves and grass in holes in trees; the unsuspicious <i>Sialia</i> utilizes cavities in stumps
  or buildings, the nest and its contents resembling those of a Redstart. The breeding habits of the
  Hedge-Sparrow need no description, and those of the Alpine Accentor differ little, except that
  rocky sites are chosen.</p>

  <p>In the above section the number of eggs varies from four to seven. The flight is feeble as
  compared with that of Thrushes, most species feeding chiefly upon the ground and being more
  insectivorous, though Redstarts and Chats will take insects on the wing.</p>

  <p>The habits of the active Sylviinae are much more uniform; they seldom fly far, except on
  migration, and a few flit about like Wrens; while <i>Amytis</i>, <i>Stipiturus</i>,
  <i>Sphenura</i>, and some species of <i>Aedon</i> run, or hop among the herbage, with upturned
  tail. They frequent trees, bushes, long grass or reeds, seldom flocking as does <i>Regulus</i>,
  and live on insects and their larvae, small molluscs and fruit, the first-named being either
  caught in the air or sought upon the leaves and branches. The song is usually clear and sweet,
  though often plaintive, metallic, or whistling; the Willow- and Wood-Warblers
  (<i>Phylloscopus</i>) trill: the Black-cap and Garden-Warblers (<i>Sylvia</i>) have beautiful
  songs, as well as grating alarm notes; the Cataract-bird (<i>Origma</i>) runs along rocky
  water-courses emitting shrill cries; the Reed- and Sedge-Warblers (<i>Acrocephalus</i>), the
  skulking <i>Cettia</i>, and other marsh- and grass-frequenting forms, utter more or less jarring
  sounds, generally from some bush, whence they quickly drop to cover; while the
  Grasshopper-Warblers (<i>Locustella</i>) have a peculiar cricket-like note.</p>

  <p>The nest may be a thin or fairly substantial cup of grasses, bed-straw (<i>Galium</i>) and the
  like, occasionally lined with hair, and placed in bushes or rank herbage, as in the Black-cap,
  Garden-Warbler and White-throats (<i>Sylvia</i>); or a firmer structure, including wool, moss,
  feathers, reed-flowers, or even lichens, built on the ground, in shrubs, in sedge, or between
  reed-stems, as is the case in <i>Locustella</i>, <i>Acrocephalus</i>, <i>Aedon</i>, and
  <i>Hypolais</i>. <i>Phylloscopus</i>, as well as some African and many Indian and Australian
  members of the Sub-family, fashion a round ball of grass and a little moss, lined with finer
  grasses, hair, down, or feathers, and generally place it close to the earth; <i>Regulus</i> hangs
  a cup of moss and spiders' webs, bedded with feathers, below the end of a conifer or other <span
  class="pagenum" id="page518"><span class="smaller">{518}</span></span>branch, or even builds it in
  creepers. Savi's Warbler (<i>Locustella luscinio&iuml;des</i>) makes a Rail-like nest of broad
  grass-blades (<i>Glyceria</i>) in sedges, <i>Myiomoira</i> one of bark, grass, wool, moss, and
  fibres in holes in trees, <i>Miro</i> a similar fabric on their branches, <i>Acanthiza</i> a domed
  hanging structure of like materials, <i>Origma</i> a ragged pendent mass of moss and roots, lined
  with fur or feathers, under rocks. <i>Orthotomus</i> (Tailor-bird) and some species of
  <i>Franklinia</i>, <i>Prinia</i>, and <i>Cisticola</i> stitch together the edges of a leaf or
  leaves to sustain their nest of grass, cotton, wool, and hair.</p>

  <p>The number of eggs is generally from three to six, but as many as twelve are found in
  <i>Regulus</i>. The colour is buffish-white with brownish and violet-grey spots in Savi's Warbler;
  pinker with delicate red-brown freckling in the Grasshopper-Warbler; rich red-brown in
  <i>Cettia</i> and <i>Chthonicola</i>; similar or varying to blue, green, white or pinkish, with or
  without red or brown spots, in <i>Prinia</i>&ndash;even in the same species; little different in
  <i>Cisticola</i>; bronzy-brown in <i>Pyrrholaemus</i>; white or purplish with dark markings in
  <i>Sericornis</i>; white in <i>Origma</i> and <i>Cryptolopha</i>. In <i>Sylvia</i> the eggs are
  greenish- or yellowish-white with olive, brown, green, or reddish spots; in <i>Acrocephalus</i>
  they are decidedly greener; in <i>Aedon</i> greyer with brown and dull violet markings; in
  <i>Phylloscopus</i> and <i>Acanthiza</i> white, usually with dark red or purplish spotting; in
  <i>Hypolais</i> lilac-pink with blackish or brown blotches or streaks; in <i>Regulus</i> white,
  freckled or entirely suffused with yellowish or ruddy dots.</p>

  <p><i>Myiodectes</i> frequents woods and thickets, and has somewhat Thrush-like habits; the voice
  is powerful, clear and metallic; while the food consists chiefly of berries, though insects are
  hawked for in the air. The nest, placed on bushes, stumps, banks or rocks, is made of sticks lined
  with soft materials, or of twigs, roots, and moss, and contains from three to six eggs, not unlike
  those of the Redbreast.</p>

  <p><i>Polioptila</i> haunts tall trees or shrubs in pairs or small companies; the habits are
  restless, the flight is quick, the food consists of gnats and so forth, commonly captured on the
  wing. The purse-like nest is felted with bark, fibres, and down, and decorated with lichens; it is
  woven to boughs, stems, or creepers, and contains four or five greenish- or bluish-white eggs,
  marked with red-brown, lilac, and grey.</p>

  <p>Of the Miminae, <i>Mimus polyglottus</i> is the Mocking-bird in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page519"><span class="smaller">{519}</span></span>chief; the natural song being rich, varied,
  and powerful, and the imitations ranging from the yelp of the Eagle to the noises of the
  farm-yard. It is found from the United States to Mexico and the Antilles, where in isolated trees,
  hedges, or brambles it makes a bulky platform of rough twigs to support the cup of roots, wool,
  and so forth, which contains the four to six pale greenish-blue&ndash;or rarely
  buffish&ndash;eggs, with brown and purplish markings. The movements are energetic but graceful,
  the flight Thrush-like; the food consists of insects, often taken in the air, and fruit. <i>Mimus
  modulator</i>, the "Calandria," of Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia, feeds chiefly on the ground,
  and can hardly be said to mock, though <i>M. triurus</i> of the same countries does so.
  <i>Galeoscoptes carolinensis</i>, the Cat-bird, besides an attractive song, utters clucks,
  whistles, and mewing sounds; it feeds chiefly on insect-larvae, and deposits from three to five
  deep greenish-blue eggs in a nest of twigs, bark, and plant-stalks lined with grass.
  <i>Oreoscoptes</i>, of the North American sage-brush districts, resembles <i>Mimus</i> in its
  habits, nest, and eggs, but is no mimic; nor, it may be added, are the shy Thrashers
  (<i>Harporhynchus</i>), which commonly haunt arid situations, placing their large, flattish nest
  of coarse twigs, leaves, fibres, bark, grass, and moss, lined with softer materials, in low trees
  or thorny scrub. Their three to six eggs are white, bluish, greenish, or buff, with yellowish,
  purplish, or red-brown spots or specks, those of the more terrestrial <i>H. crissalis</i> being
  uniform pale greenish-blue. <i>Donacobius</i> frequents reeds, but possibly does not belong to
  this group; <i>Melanoptila</i> has a harsh or mewing note, and lays blue eggs, as does
  <i>Melanotis</i>.</p>

  <p>Fam. VIII. <b>Cinclidae.</b>&ndash;The Dippers or Water-Ousels form a single genus,
  <i>Cinclus</i>, probably more akin to the Wrens than to the Thrushes. The bill is moderate and
  straight, without bristles at the gape, the maxilla being slightly curved and notched; the smooth
  metatarsi are fairly long and strong; the wings are abbreviated, rounded, and concave; the tail is
  extremely short, and the whole body peculiarly squat-looking. The colour above is normally
  greyish-black or brown, <i>C. ardesiacus</i> being, however, delicate grey; the lower parts are
  similar or white, commonly with a black belly, while a chestnut band crosses the breast in the
  British <i>C. aquaticus</i> and in <i>C. albicollis</i>. White spots often occur above and below
  the eye; <i>C. leuconotus</i> and <i>C. leucocephalus</i> have nearly white heads, and the former
  shews white on the back. <span class="pagenum" id="page520"><span
  class="smaller">{520}</span></span>The sexes are alike, but the young are spotted. Both plumage
  and down are close and nearly impervious to water.</p>

  <p>These birds range throughout the Palaearctic Region, just reaching the southern slopes of the
  Himalayas, China, and Formosa. One species occupies the Atlas Mountains, while others occur along
  the heights of Western America, and the Andes southwards to Peru. Individuals of a dark form from
  Northern Europe occasionally stray to Britain, but such migration is exceptional.</p>

  <p>Dippers frequent rapid streams in hill-country, which seldom freeze, and appear as cheery in
  winter as in summer; their flight is powerful, rapid, and direct, with quick wing-strokes and
  sudden descent; their cry upon the wing is loud and clear, their song when stationary Wren-like.
  They sit on stones in the water, bobbing up and down and jerking their tails, while they use both
  legs and wings below the surface, whither they dive noiselessly in search of insects, their larvae
  and pupae, or molluscs. Fish-spawn has not been found in the stomach. The domed, but flattened,
  nest is composed chiefly of moss or grass, with an inner bed of dry materials, which are generally
  oak or beech leaves, though in India sometimes ferns and roots. It is affixed to rock-faces,
  ledges, or boulders in streams, placed in crevices of masonry, or even built in holes in the soil
  or in d&eacute;bris caught on bushes, common situations being behind water-falls, under bridges, or
  beside mill-wheels. <i>C. albicollis</i> seems to make an open fabric in Italy. From four to seven
  dull white eggs are laid very early in the season, two or even three sets being often
  produced&ndash;occasionally in the same nest. This the young sometimes leave by the end of March,
  being able to swim before they are fully fledged.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page521"><span class="smaller">{521}</span></span></div>

  <p>Fam. IX. <b>Troglodytidae.</b>&ndash;The Wrens have their headquarters in Tropical America, but
  even reach Greenland, Patagonia, and the Falkland Islands. Four genera with some eight species
  inhabit the Himalayas, the hills of West China, the Burmese countries, Sumatra and Java; while
  <i>Troglodytes</i>, including the common Wren, occupies most of the Palaearctic and Nearctic
  Regions. An altitude of eleven thousand feet is attained in certain cases.</p>

  <p>The bill is generally moderate, slender, and somewhat arched; being, however, stouter and
  almost hooked in <i>Thryothorus</i> and <i>Campylorhynchus</i>, much elongated in
  <i>Catherpes</i>, <i>Salpinctes</i>, and <i>Microcerculus</i>, high and compressed in
  <i>Cyphorhinus</i>, remarkably conical, straight, and pointed in <i>Sphenocichla</i>. The maxilla
  may be notched, but rictal bristles are almost entirely absent. The long robust metatarsi are
  scutellated anteriorly, except in <i>Pno&euml;pyga</i>; <i>Salpinctes</i> shews scales behind;
  <i>Cistothorus</i> has a very large hind claw. The wings are rounded and concave; the tail is
  usually short and graduated, though it is exceptionally long in <i>Cinnicerthia</i>,
  <i>Sphenocichla</i>, and <i>Urocichla</i>, and is hardly visible in three species of
  <i>Pno&euml;pyga</i>. The last-named genus has only six rectrices, <i>Urocichla</i> has ten. The
  coloration is ordinarily brown, with a great tendency to barring; spots, stripes, and streaks are
  not uncommon; chestnut, bay, orange, and grey often relieve the dulness; <i>Troglodytes
  formosus</i>, <i>Catherpes</i>, and <i>Henicorhina</i> exhibit white spots above or even below;
  and two species of <i>Microcerculus</i> have a white alar bar.</p>

  <p>Wrens frequent marshy, as well as dry or rocky localities, being familiar and yet wary; they
  habitually hop about with upturned tails, fly sharply from cover to cover, and hunt for insects,
  their larvae, and spiders, among fallen leaves, in crevices of rocks, and so forth, while they
  occasionally eat worms, small molluscs, crustaceans, and seeds. The characteristic note is shrill
  and Warbler-like, though harsher sounds accompany it, but <i>Cyphorhinus cantans</i>, the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page522"><span class="smaller">{522}</span></span>Organ-bird of the Amazons,
  <i>Troglodytes domesticus</i> (<i>aedon</i>), <i>Microcerculus</i>, and other American forms utter
  melodious flute-like strains. The nest is usually a domed structure of ferns, grass, moss, leaves,
  or even twigs, often lined with hair or feathers, which is placed in bushes, hedges, cacti, reeds,
  and cavities of masonry, or on trees, rocks, banks, and the like; <i>Salpinctes</i>,
  <i>Catherpes</i>, <i>Urocichla</i> and sometimes <i>Pno&euml;pyga</i> make no covering;
  <i>Campylorhynchus</i> fashions a large purse-like structure, with a long passage for entrance.
  The eggs vary in number from three to nine, and are white, with or without spots or freckles of
  red, purplish, or brownish; in <i>Thryophilus pleurostictus</i> they are said to be blue.</p>

  <p>Fam. X. <b>Chamaeidae.</b>&ndash;This contains only <i>Chamaea fasciata</i> and <i>C.
  henshawi</i> of California, which by various American authorities have been referred to the Wrens
  or the Tits, though not agreeing closely with either. This is the only <i>Family</i> of land birds
  peculiar to the Nearctic Region. In both sexes the lax plumage is brown above and buffish below,
  with faint tail-bars and pectoral streaks; the bill is short, straight, and compressed, and is
  furnished with rictal bristles; the metatarsi are stout and nearly smooth; the wings are rounded
  and concave; the tail is graduated. <i>Chamaea</i> inhabits dry plains and bushy hill-sides, flits
  about or searches for insects with elevated tail, utters a Wren-like trill, and builds a nest of
  twigs and grass in low bushes, adding hair or feathers to the lining, and laying three or four
  pale greenish-blue eggs.</p>

  <p>Fam. XI. <b>Hirundinidae.</b>&ndash;The Swallows and Martins compose a well-defined
  cosmopolitan Family, certainly far removed from the Swifts (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page420">420</a></span>), with which they used to be joined. The latter have ten
  tail-feathers, and hardly any scutellation on the legs, the former twelve rectrices, and an
  anteriorly scutellated metatarsus. The bill is short, broad, and usually much depressed, being
  notched at the tip and split nearly to the eyes. The feet are very small and weak, with the middle
  digit more or less adherent to its neighbours; <i>Tachycineta</i> has a stoutish hallux,
  <i>Chelidon</i> feathered toes, and <i>Cotile riparia</i> a tuft at the back of the metatarsus.
  The wings are extremely long and pointed, while the exterior margin of the outer primary has
  hooked barbs in the males of <i>Psalidoprocne</i> and <i>Stelgidopteryx</i>. The tail varies in
  length, and is often very deeply forked, <i>Petrochelidon</i>, <i>Stelgidopteryx</i>, <i>Chelidon
  dasypus</i> and <i>Psalidoprocne</i> nitens having it <span class="pagenum" id="page523"><span
  class="smaller">{523}</span></span>exceptionally square; while the lateral feathers may be almost
  linear, as in <i>Hirundo rustica</i>, or even wire-like, as in <i>H. smithii</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Chelidon</i> is purplish- or bluish-black, or brown, having a white rump occasionally barred
  with black, and white or buffish under parts; <i>Tachycineta</i> is similar, or greener and
  somewhat bronzy, in certain cases lacking the white rump, in others shewing white mottlings above.
  <i>Hirundo</i> is glossy metallic black, with a variable amount of chestnut or rufous on the head,
  rump, or lower surface; the last of these regions exhibiting much white or having a black pectoral
  band, while streaky markings are not uncommon. <i>Cheramoeca</i> is blue, black, white, and brown
  above, and white below with a black breast-patch; <i>Procne</i> is either entirely blue-black or
  has some white beneath, <i>P. tapera</i> alone being brown, with a longitudinal band of the same
  colour on the white lower surface. <i>Atticora</i> is blue-black or greenish above, black and
  white or brown underneath; <i>Petrochelidon</i> is steel-blue with concealed white striations, the
  forehead, nape, rump, and most of the lower surface being chestnut, rufous, or buff, with or
  without stripes; <i>Psalidoprocne</i> is uniform blue, green-black, or sooty, <i>P. albiceps</i>
  having a white crown and chin. <i>Cotile</i>, <i>Phedina</i>, and <i>Stelgidopteryx</i> are dull
  brown above, the first being white, grey, brown, or rufous below, the second white with
  longitudinal brown streaks, and the third white and rufous with yellow middle to the breast and
  abdomen in two species. The plumage of most Swallows is very metallic, and white spots are often
  prominent on the tail feathers in <i>Hirundo</i>, <i>Chelidon</i>, <i>Cotile</i>, and
  <i>Petrochelidon</i>. The female is duller than the male in <i>Procne</i> only.</p>

  <p>The range of <i>Hirundo</i> and <i>Cotile</i> is practically worldwide, reaching from beyond
  the Arctic Circle in summer to South Africa, India, and Brazil in winter, not to mention resident
  southern species; no Swallow, however, occurs in New Zealand, nor is <i>Cotile</i> found in the
  Australian Region. Four species of <i>Petrochelidon</i> are found in America, two in Southern
  Africa, two in the Australian Region, and one in India&ndash;a remarkable distribution.
  <i>Psalidoprocne</i>, <i>Phedina</i>, and <i>Cheramoeca</i> are Ethiopian, Mascarene (with
  Madagascar), and Australian respectively: <i>Tachycineta</i> and <i>Procne</i> extend over the New
  World from its Arctic portions to Patagonia, <i>Atticora</i> from that country to Guatemala,
  <i>Stelgidopteryx</i> from Canada and British Columbia to Bolivia and Brazil. <i>Chelidon</i> is
  confined to the Old World, migrating in autumn to Central <span class="pagenum" id="page524"><span
  class="smaller">{524}</span></span>Africa, Borneo, and Burma. The summer migrants to Britain are
  <i>Hirundo rustica</i>, the Swallow, <i>Chelidon urbica</i>, the Martin, and <i>Cotile
  riparia</i>, the Sand-Martin. Swallows traverse immense distances on their periodical journeys,
  while all perhaps shift their quarters to some extent for the winter.</p>

  <p>Hardly any sort of country comes amiss to these birds, though the neighbourhood of water is
  preferred, and for some species seems necessary. Spending their life chiefly in the air and
  alighting comparatively little, they rapidly dart, twist, double, sail aloft, or skim the water's
  surface in company, at times chasing each other in sport or even fighting savagely. Insects, which
  form the whole of their sustenance, are habitually taken on the wing, and the young are sometimes
  fed, or building materials snatched up, in full flight. A few species not uncommonly perch on
  trees, as <i>Hirundo rustica</i>, <i>Tachycineta albiventris</i>, <i>Petrochelidon nigricans</i>,
  <i>Psalidoprocne nitens</i> and <i>Procne tapera</i>; the last-named, moreover, is exceptional in
  being non-gregarious, while it flits about with depressed wings and slow butterfly-like flight
  when not hawking. The majority are rarely seen on the ground, unless they are procuring mud for
  nidification; but many roost on reeds or in their nests, and just before migration they settle in
  crowds on branches, fences, wires, and ridges of roofs. <i>Hirundo</i>, <i>Chelidon</i>, and
  <i>Psalidoprocne</i> bask in the sun on gravelly places. The twitter or warble of
  Swallows&ndash;uttered on the wing or at rest&ndash;and their squeaks of anger or alarm, are
  well-known; the scream of <i>Procne</i> and the chirp of <i>Stelgidopteryx</i> being somewhat
  exceptional; when excited, however, the bill is not uncommonly snapped noisily. The nest may be
  cup-shaped as in our Swallow, <i>Cotile rupestris</i>, <i>C. fuligula</i>, and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page525"><span class="smaller">{525}</span></span><i>C. concolor</i>, and made
  of agglutinated pellets of mud with a lining of straw, chaff, leaves, or feathers; it may be
  similarly constructed but semi-ovate, with a hole near the top, as in the Martin; or retort-shaped
  with a tube for entrance at the side, as in several members of the genera <i>Hirundo</i> and
  <i>Petrochelidon</i>: in these cases it may be placed inside buildings, under eaves, against rocks
  or walls. <i>Procne</i>&ndash;when not accommodated with a box&ndash;some species of
  <i>Tachycineta</i>, <i>Petrochelidon nigricans</i>, and other forms, not uncommonly prefer holes
  in trees, lining them as usual, if at all; while many species of <i>Cotile</i>,
  <i>Psalidoprocne</i>, and <i>Cheramoeca</i> tunnel in banks, or, more rarely, choose holes in
  masonry. <i>Procne furcata</i> utilizes the holes of <i>Conurus patachonius</i>; <i>P. tapera</i>
  the nests of <i>Furnarius rufus</i> in Argentina; <i>Tachycineta leucorrhous</i> occasionally that
  of <i>Anumbius</i>; <i>Atticora cyanoleuca</i> that of the Dendrocolaptine <i>Geositta</i>, itself
  within that of a biscacha. The eggs are from four to seven in number, generally pure white in
  Martins, and whitish with reddish-brown, grey, and lilac markings in Swallows; but the cases are
  occasionally reversed. Two or even three broods are reared in a season, and tended with the
  greatest care. Colonies are frequently formed, especially by Bank- and Cliff-Swallows. In Britain
  the Sand-Martin arrives first, but the Swallow comes early in April, while individuals have even
  been obtained in winter.</p>

  <p>Fam. XII. <b>Campephagidae.</b>&ndash;The "Cuckoo-Shrikes" are commonly placed near the
  <i>Laniidae</i>, but are possibly connected with the <i>Muscicapidae</i> or the <i>Corvidae</i>.
  The bill is usually strong, and of moderate length, being hooked, arched, and wide at the base; it
  is especially stout in <i>Artamides</i>, decidedly weaker in <i>Campephaga</i>, long and thin in
  <i>Edoliisoma</i>. The metatarsus may be elongated and comparatively robust as in
  <i>Pteropodocys</i>, <i>Lalage</i>, and <i>Symmorphus</i>, or short and less powerful, as in
  <i>Pericrocotus</i>; the wings are normally long and pointed, and more particularly so in
  <i>Pericrocotus</i>, <i>Lalage</i>, <i>Symmorphus</i>, and <i>Graucalus</i>. The tail is also
  fairly long, and frequently rounded, though it may be forked, as in <i>Pteropodocys</i>, and to a
  less extent in <i>Campechaera</i>, or graduated as in <i>Pericrocotus</i>, <i>Campephaga</i>, and
  <i>Graucalus</i>. The plumage is soft, with characteristically stiff shafts on the lower back; the
  nostrils are nearly concealed by the feathers; the rictal bristles are feeble. The usual
  coloration is either bluish-grey with a certain amount of black and white, or chiefly black and
  white. The black has generally a purplish or <span class="pagenum" id="page526"><span
  class="smaller">{526}</span></span>a greenish gloss; while barring occurs occasionally in the
  cocks, and much more commonly in the hens, where the tints are duller, the grey lighter, and the
  hue in some cases brown or even rufous. The Mascarene <i>Oxynotus</i> is almost unique among Birds
  in having the males of the two species alike, the females very different. Shaft-streaks on the
  feathers are fairly frequent; two species of <i>Lalage</i> have a chestnut lower surface, and one
  the rump similar; while <i>Symmorphus</i> is either brown above and whitish below, or black and
  white with buff rump and under parts. <i>Campechaera</i> is green and golden-yellow in both sexes,
  but shews some black, white, and grey as well; <i>Lobotus</i> is olive-yellow with dark green head
  and throat, orange-chestnut rump and breast, greenish tail, and an orange lobe at the gape.
  <i>Pericrocotus</i> is usually black, adorned with lovely scarlet, crimson, orange, or yellow
  markings, and with a little white, but two species lack the brilliant tints, and others replace
  the black by brown or grey; the females in this genus usually have yellow where the males have
  red, though they also shew red in two cases. Three African species of <i>Campephaga</i> vary from
  the ordinary grey or blackish coloration in being glossy bluish-black, with scarlet, orange, and
  yellow shoulder-patches respectively, and one in being steel-green, with purple face and neck, and
  steel-blue lower surface. In these forms the females have yellow markings. Finally, <i>Graucalus
  azureus</i> is azure and black, with a shade of cobalt.</p>

  <p>The restless and active members of this Family are generally seen in small flocks in wooded
  country, gardens, orchards, and hedge-rows. They are found up to an altitude of ten thousand feet
  throughout the Ethiopian, Indian, and Australian Regions, and even reach Amurland;
  <i>Graucalus</i> inhabits all three Regions, but <i>Oxynotus</i> is peculiar to Mauritius and
  R&eacute;union. The flight is easy, undulating, and strong, though of brief duration; while the birds hop
  and frisk about the branches, or move briskly from tree to tree, as they examine the crevices of
  the bark or the leaves, and occasionally pluck the fruit. They may occasionally be noticed darting
  to the earth to secure caterpillars, of which they are extremely fond, or sallying into the air
  after insects, like Flycatchers. <i>Pericrocotus</i> is said to hang to the boughs like a Tit;
  <i>Pteropodocys</i> lives chiefly on the ground. The mellow and lively notes are of a whistling or
  twittering nature, varied by jarring sounds; but all the species are rather silent. The nest,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page527"><span class="smaller">{527}</span></span>composed of twigs and
  grass, or of moss and leaves, is usually very shallow, and is covered with lichens and spiders'
  webs; it is placed on slender branches of trees, or more rarely in bushes. The two to five
  Shrike-like eggs are brownish, whitish, or apple-green, with markings of brown, rufous, or purple.
  Those of the isabelline-coloured <i>Hypocolius ampelinus</i>, which possibly belongs to the
  Ampelidae, are white with plumbeous spots.</p>

  <p>Fam. XIII. <b>Dicruridae.</b>&ndash;The Drongos, usually associated with the <i>Laniidae</i>,
  range throughout the Ethiopian, Indian, and Australian regions, as far east as New Britain and New
  Ireland <span class="pagenum" id="page528"><span class="smaller">{528}</span></span>(<i>Dicranostreptus</i>).
  <i>Chibia bracteata</i> is the only species in Australia, while <i>Buchanga leucogenys</i> is said
  to reach Japan; <i>B. waldeni</i> is peculiar to Mayotte, and <i>Edolius forficatus</i> to
  Madagascar and Joanna Island. Both sexes are typically black, with a metallic gloss of blue,
  purple, or green, though a few are greyer or browner, or have a little white below. The variable
  bill is usually large and more or less curved, with a hooked tip, a notched maxilla, and fairly
  strong rictal bristles&ndash;much developed in <i>Chaetorhynchus</i>. The metatarsi are short, the
  toes small, the wings long. The tail has only ten rectrices, and is generally very deeply forked,
  though less so in <i>Dicrurus</i>, <i>Chibia</i>, and <i>Chaetorhynchus</i>. In <i>Chibia</i> the
  two outer feathers are slightly elongated and turned up, in <i>Dissemuro&iuml;des</i> they are produced
  and recurved at the tip, in <i>Dicranostreptus</i> they are extraordinarily lengthened and turned
  to face one another. In <i>Bhringa</i> and <i>Dissemurus</i> the long bare shafts terminate in
  racquets, and have a twist that brings the upper side inwards in the former, and one in the
  racquet itself in the latter. On the forehead a large, erect tuft occurs in <i>Edolius</i>, a
  still more extensive recurved crest in <i>Dissemurus</i>, a bunch of long, silky hairs in
  <i>Chibia hottentotta</i>. A few similar hairs are found in <i>C. pectoralis</i>, and scanty
  plumes in <i>C. bima&euml;nsis</i>; <i>Dissemuro&iuml;des</i> having the one or the other. Various species
  exhibit a tendency to lanceolate hackles on the head and neck, while the feathers of the former
  are scaly-looking in <i>Chaetorhynchus</i>. The bill and feet are black; the eyes red, white, or
  brown.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These wary, active birds frequent gardens, open country, and forests up to at least eight
  thousand feet, more usually in pairs <span class="pagenum" id="page529"><span
  class="smaller">{529}</span></span>than in companies; their flight is strong and rapid, but
  undulating and not sustained, while they are often seen perched on bushes or exposed branches, and
  occasionally hover like a Kestrel. The song or whistle is ringing and melodious, varied by harsh
  chattering or creaking sounds; the food consists of insects of all kinds, which are captured on
  the ground, on leaves or flowers, on the backs of cattle, or at times upon the wing, individuals
  often returning to their perches like Flycatchers. Drongos are good mimics, fight viciously, and
  are very courageous, mastering even Hawks and Crows. The nest is a shallow cup of twigs, roots,
  leaves, fine grass, lichens, hair, and cobwebs, often so slight that the contents can be seen from
  below: it is usually woven into a horizontal fork like that of an Oriole, but may be fixed among
  bamboos, and often overhangs water. The eggs, rarely more than three or four in number, are
  sometimes plain white, but usually pink, buff, or white, with red, brown, claret, purplish, or
  grey spots and blotches. Not uncommonly a second set is found in a nest whence the first has been
  taken. A curious instance of "unconscious mimicry" is that of <i>Buchanga atra</i> and the Indian
  Cuckoo <i>Surniculus dicruro&iuml;des</i>, the plumage being exactly the same, though the feet
  distinguish them at once.</p>

  <p>Fam. XIV. <b>Ampelidae.</b>&ndash;In this group most forms have a short, depressed bill, though
  it is longer with bristly gape in <i>Phaenoptila</i>, and stouter in <i>Dulus</i>; they have
  abbreviated metatarsi, not scutellated in <i>Phaenoptila</i>; the wings are long and pointed in
  <i>Ampelis</i>, shorter and roundish elsewhere; the tails vary from short and even in
  <i>Ampelis</i> to long and rounded in <i>Phaenopepla</i>, or cuneate with elongated median
  feathers in <i>Ptilogenys caudatus</i>.</p>

  <p>Both sexes of our irregular winter-visitor the Waxwing (<i>Ampelis garrulus</i>) are silky
  greyish-brown, with blackish wings, and tail relieved by yellow and white; a black forehead,
  eye-stripe, and throat; chestnut under tail-coverts and basal margin of the erectile crest; and,
  in the adults, flattened wax-like tips to the shafts of the secondaries or even the rectrices. The
  young are streaked below. Breeding near the Arctic Circle, and changing its quarters erratically,
  it occurs in the New as well as in the Old World, while in winter it migrates southwards to at
  least lat. 43&deg; N. The flight is easy, graceful, and often high; the notes are of a trilling or of
  a chirping nature; the food consists of insects, berries, and other fruit. The nest of twigs and
  fibrous lichens, or <span class="pagenum" id="page530"><span class="smaller">{530}</span></span>of
  grass and bark, is placed on firs or birches, and contains from five to seven purplish-grey or
  drab eggs, with spots of black, brown, or lilac. The smaller North American <i>A. cedrorum</i>
  lacks the yellow and white on the wing; <i>A. phoenicoptera</i>, of Japan, North China, and East
  Siberia, has red, but not wax-like, tips to the remiges and rectrices.</p>

  <p><i>Dulus dominicus</i>, of San Domingo, is dark brown, varied with greenish and yellow, the
  yellowish-white lower surface shewing broad brown streaks. Several pairs often join their nests of
  twigs into a circular mass. <i>Phaenoptila melanoxantha</i>, of the Costa Rican hill-valleys, is
  glossy black, having an olive rump-band, and similarly coloured under parts with yellow sides and
  grey middle. The female is olive above with black crown. <i>Phaenopepla nitens</i>, of Mexico and
  the Southern United States, is bluish-black, with white on the primaries and vent-region; it has
  an erectile occipital crest. The hen is dark grey, with brown abdomen and a different distribution
  of white. This shy, active bird has the graceful movements of a Flycatcher, with a habit of
  jerking the tail; the song is plaintive or whistling; the food consists of insects and fruit. The
  flat nest, of fibres, grass, and down, contains from two to five greyish eggs, speckled with
  brownish-black and neutral tints: <i>Ptilogenys cinereus</i>, of the highlands of Central America,
  is plumbeous, with black remiges, black and white rectrices, loose broad lavender crest-plumes,
  and yellow under tail-coverts and flanks; the female is chiefly brown.</p>

  <p>Fam. XV. <b>Artamidae.</b>&ndash;The "Wood-Swallows" constitute a group of very doubtful
  position, ranging from the Australian to the Indian Region and in one case (<i>Pseudochelidon</i>)
  to West Africa. In the last-named the bill is broad, but elsewhere it is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page531"><span class="smaller">{531}</span></span>long, pointed, and slightly curved, with
  wide gape. The metatarsi are short and strong; the wings are much elongated; the tail is short and
  occasionally emarginate, with soft, exserted shafts to the rectrices in <i>Pseudochelidon</i>,
  which is glossy greenish-black with red beak and feet. <i>Artamus</i>, where powder-down patches
  occur on the sides, thighs, and lower back, exhibits black, brown, rufous, or grey tints, relieved
  by white&ndash;especially below, or towards the tip of the tail; the bill is blue with black
  extremity, the feet are greyish. The sexes hardly differ.</p>

  <p>These woodland birds often float nearly motionless in the air, occasionally moving ahead with a
  few strokes of the wing; at other times they wheel and twist about like Swifts. They hawk for
  insects, or sally after them from their perches, feeding also upon the ground, on the larvae and
  on seeds. Congregating like Swallows, they have in Australia a curious habit of hanging in
  ball-like masses from the branches; the note is plaintive or chirping. The nests, often found in
  close proximity, are placed in forks of trees, on their side-shoots, in holes, behind loose bark,
  in deserted habitations of other birds, or in bushes; the outer materials being twigs and grass,
  those of the lining fibres and feathers. From two to four white, greenish, or flesh-coloured eggs
  are deposited, spotted and streaked with umber, red-brown, grey, lilac, or occasionally black.</p>

  <p>Fam. XVI. <b>Laniidae.</b>&ndash;Few Families are more difficult to define than this. A typical
  Shrike is easily recognised; but such forms as <i>Pachycephala</i> and <i>Hemipus</i> are closely
  connected with the <i>Muscicapidae</i>; <i>Calicalicus</i> and <i>Neolestes</i> with the
  <i>Pycnonotidae</i>; <i>Gymnorhina</i> and its allies with the <i>Corvidae</i>; while some authors
  include the <i>Campephagidae</i>. Dr. Gadow<a id="NtA_287" href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a>
  recognises five Sub-families: (1) <i>Gymnorhininae</i>, (2) <i>Malaconotinae</i>, (3)
  <i>Pachycephalinae</i>, (4) <i>Laniinae</i>, and (5) <i>Vireoninae</i>; but the last-named is here
  allowed Family rank, while <i>Prionopinae</i> is admitted in its place.</p>

  <p>The bill is stout, notched, and often strongly hooked, while it is either curved or straight;
  in <i>Falcunculus</i> it is more than usually compressed, in <i>Rhectes</i> the maxilla has the
  edge finely serrated, in <i>Xenopirostris</i> the mandible is upcurved, leaving a distinct gap
  above it. In the <i>Gymnorhininae</i> the culmen is long, straight, and slightly rounded, with
  slit-like nostrils near <span class="pagenum" id="page532"><span
  class="smaller">{532}</span></span>the middle. The variable metatarsus is very strong in the
  larger forms, and much weaker in the <i>Prionopinae</i>; it is perhaps shortest in the
  <i>Malaconotinae</i>, where&ndash;as in all the Family&ndash;the scutes tend more or less to fuse.
  In <i>Calicalicus</i> and <i>Nicator</i> the basal joints of the third and fourth toes are united.
  The wings&ndash;usually moderate&ndash;may be very long and pointed, as in <i>Gymnorhina</i> and
  <i>Pityriasis</i>, or abbreviated and much rounded, as in <i>Telephonus</i> and <i>Laniarius</i>;
  the rather short tail is rarely emarginate, but frequently has acuminate feathers; while it may be
  square or rounded, or at times graduated, as in <i>Laniarius</i>, <i>Laniellus</i>,
  <i>Paeoptera</i>, <i>Telephonus</i>, <i>Ptererythrius</i>, some species of <i>Lanius</i>, and
  still more <i>Urolestes</i>, where the two median rectrices are exceptionally elongated.
  <i>Falcunculus</i> and <i>Oreoeca</i> have well-developed erectile crests; <i>Rhectes</i>,
  <i>Sigmodus</i>, <i>Pseudorhectes</i>, and <i>Melanorhectes</i> also exhibit lengthened
  head-plumes; <i>Platylophus</i> has these feathers broad and extraordinarily long; while
  <i>Prionops</i> has in addition frontal feathers overhanging the nostrils. <i>Pityriasis</i> has a
  bare yellow crown, the ear-coverts and lower throat being covered by brown bristles with red
  bases: <i>Leptopterus</i>, <i>Prionops</i>, and <i>Sigmodus</i> have a fleshy wattle round the
  eye. Rictal and nasal hairs may be highly developed or absent. The sexes are generally similar,
  except in the Pachycephalinae, and to some extent in the Prionopinae.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 1. <i>Gymnorhininae.</i>&ndash;The remarkable red and black <i>Pityriasis
  gymnocephala</i> inhabits Borneo; the black and white <i>Gymnorhina</i> Australia, with Tasmania;
  the black, white, and grey <i>Strepera</i> the same countries, <i>Cracticus</i> Papuasia also.
  <i>Gymnorhina</i> and <i>Cracticus</i> have the beak bluish-white. <i>Strepera</i> occurs in
  parties in open wooded districts or swamps, feeding chiefly upon the ground on insects, their
  larvae, and a little fruit; while it runs, hops, or leaps from branch to branch with great
  agility, but generally flies low and feebly. It is a bold bird with a shrill, ringing,
  oft-repeated cry. The nest, as large as that of a Crow, is placed in the fork of a low tree, and
  is formed of sticks and twigs with a lining of bark, grass, leaves, wool, or hair; three or four
  pale chocolate- or reddish-brown eggs, with faint red or lilac markings, being deposited.
  <i>Gymnorhina</i>, the Piping Crow, resembles <i>Strepera</i> in habits, though its single, clear
  notes are somewhat different, and it can be taught to whistle or mimic. <i>G. hyperleuca</i> of
  Tasmania is called the Organ-bird, as <i>Cyphorhinus</i> (p. 522) is in Amazonia. The eggs vary
  from brown to whitish, <span class="pagenum" id="page533"><span
  class="smaller">{533}</span></span>bright green, or sky blue, with smears, dashes, spots, or
  freckles of lilac and brown. The shy <i>Cracticus</i> is more arboreal, and eats mice, young
  birds, lizards, and even crabs, in addition to insects, upon which <i>C. destructor</i> darts like
  a Flycatcher, impaling its prey subsequently after the fashion of a Shrike. The cry in this genus
  bears a general resemblance to that of the above forms; the eggs are equally variable, and may
  have zonal markings.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 2. <i>Malaconotinae</i>.&ndash;These African and Indian birds are commonly black,
  white, and chestnut; <i>Laniarius</i>, however, is chiefly red, green, and yellow; <i>Nicator</i>,
  <i>Neolestes</i>, and several species of <i>Ptererythrius</i> shew much yellow and green; while
  <i>Artamia leucocephala</i> is greenish-black, and <i>A. bicolor</i> chiefly cobalt, both having
  the head and under parts white. The feathers of the back are very broad, soft, and fluffy.
  <i>Vanga</i>, <i>Artamia</i>, <i>Xenopirostris</i>, and <i>Calicalicus</i> are peculiar to
  Madagascar; unless <i>Clytorhynchus pachycephalo&iuml;des</i> of New Caledonia and the New Hebrides be
  referred to <i>Xenopirostris</i>. Between <i>X. polleni</i> and <i>Tylas eduardi</i>
  (Pycnonotidae) a most curious instance of "unconscious mimicry" exists. The retiring members of
  this Sub-family are commonly seen hopping or climbing about thick undergrowth in search of insects
  and their larvae, or hunting for worms and spiders on the ground; they run well and fly fairly,
  while some forms, as <i>Dryoscopus cubla</i> and <i>D. rufiventris</i>, puff out their feathers
  until the body resembles a black and white ball. The voice of <i>Laniarius rubiginosus</i> has
  been compared to that of a Nightingale, and other species utter ringing notes, sweet or melancholy
  whistles, or at times loud, discordant cries or "churrs." The nest&ndash;where
  known&ndash;consists of twigs, grass, wool, hair, and feathers, and contains from three to five
  greenish-white eggs with brown spots; it is placed in a bush, or among close-growing plants. The
  male occasionally incubates.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 3. <i>Pachycephalinae</i>.&ndash;This group, which extends from most of Polynesia and
  Australia to Tenasserim and the Great Sunda Islands, shews brown, black, white, grey, yellow, and
  olive hues, the yellow being somewhat characteristic. The majority of the members hop actively
  about leafy trees, or search the ground for insects, their larvae, and berries; <i>Falcunculus</i>
  takes short, quick flights, clings to the boughs like a Tit, and often tears off the bark; while
  <i>Pachycephala simplex</i> prefers swampy ground, and behaves like a Flycatcher. Some species
  have a low, mournful, reiterated note, others a continuous whistle, often ending with a <span
  class="pagenum" id="page534"><span class="smaller">{534}</span></span>smacking sound, others again
  have a sweet song. The nest of <i>Pachycephala</i> is a neat, though sometimes frail, cup of
  twigs, roots, and grasses, often placed on horizontal boughs, and containing three or four creamy
  or brownish eggs, with scattered or zonal umber markings and a few lilac spots; <i>Falcunculus</i>
  usually selects a gum-tree, and uses bark, grass, and cobwebs, laying two or three elongated
  whitish eggs, with olive, black, and greyish dots or lines; those of <i>Oreoeca</i> are bluer.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 4. <i>Laniinae.</i>&ndash;The Shrikes proper extend over the Palaearctic, Indian, and
  Ethiopian Regions, and alone of the Family occur in the New World, <i>Lanius borealis</i> and
  <i>L. ludovicianus</i> inhabiting North America. The lax plumage is either black, grey, and white,
  or is varied with rich red-brown. <i>Urolestes</i> has the feathers of the crown and neck
  lanceolate, and those of the sides long and fluffy; <i>Laniellus</i> is exceptional in being
  spotted. The young are browner, and are often transversely barred below, a fact also true of the
  <i>Gymnorhininae</i>. In the large genus <i>Lanius</i> are included all the British Butcher-Birds,
  <i>L. excubitor</i>, <i>L. minor</i>, <i>L. pomeranus</i>, <i>L. collurio</i>, the Great Grey,
  Lesser Grey, Woodchat <span class="pagenum" id="page535"><span
  class="smaller">{535}</span></span>and Red-backed Shrikes, of which only the last-named breeds in
  our island. The Sub-family contains many of these quarrelsome, rapacious birds, often seen perched
  on the tops of bushes, or chasing each other along the hedge-rows. The flight is strong and rapid,
  but undulating and brief; the food, which may be taken on the wing, or procured upon the ground,
  consists of small mammals and birds, insects, snakes, lizards, frogs, or even crabs and fruit, the
  creatures not devoured at once being impaled on thorns or spiky leaves. The larders are usually
  near the nest, which is a bulky mass of twigs, grass, and the like, with a softer lining, placed
  in a thick bush or fairly high up a tree; the four to seven eggs vary from green to reddish-buff
  or whitish, and are spotted, blotched, and generally zoned, with brown, red, olive, green, or a
  little grey. Sometimes the male incubates. The usual note is harsh and grating, but shriller cries
  or sweeter songs are not uncommon, while certain species are good mimics. Pellets of the
  indigestible portions of the food are ejected after eating, as in Birds of prey, and
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Sub-fam. 5. <i>Prionopinae.</i>&ndash;The "Wood-Shrikes" are usually dull in colour, though
  some have the normal browns, greys, and blacks relieved by bright chestnut, fawn, or
  yellowish-white, and several are black and white, or uniform black. They frequent trees and
  bushes, and eat molluscs and fruit; but live chiefly upon insects captured on the branches or on
  the ground, if not by darting into the air from a perch. Their flight, rapid but short, is
  commonly performed with quivering wings; they hop easily upon the ground; while their notes take
  the form of a rather pleasing Thrush-like song or a harsh chatter. The slight, loose nest, built
  in a low fork, in the hollow of a stump, or even on a rocky ledge, is made of moss, grass, bark,
  roots, wool, feathers, lichens, cobwebs, or downy seeds; the three eggs being white, greenish, or
  buff, often with brown, black, and grey blotches, dashes, freckles, or zones.</p>

  <p><i>Grallina</i>, the "Magpie-Lark" of Australia and New Guinea, doubtfully placed here,
  possesses vocal organs abnormal for an Oscinine bird.<a id="NtA_288"
  href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> Graceful and tame, it frequents homesteads, stream-sides, and
  swamps, having a heavy, flapping flight, uttering a shrill, plaintive whistle, and plastering a
  nest of mud and grass on some horizontal bough. The three or four eggs are white or pinkish,
  marked or zoned with red, brown, and lilac.</p>

  <p>The Helmet-bird of Madagascar (<i>Euryceros prevosti</i>), a purplish-black <span
  class="pagenum" id="page536"><span class="smaller">{536}</span></span>and chestnut species, with a
  compressed, swollen and hooked steel-blue beak exhibiting a pearly interior, should perhaps stand
  in a separate Family, <i>Eurycerotidae</i>, and not with the Shrikes.</p>

  <p>Fam. XVII. <b>Vireonidae.</b>&ndash;The small group of "Greenlets" ranges from Winnipeg and
  Nova Scotia to Argentina. The compressed or depressed beak varies from stout and strongly hooked,
  as in <i>Vireolanius</i> and <i>Cyclorhis</i>, to small and comparatively weak as in
  <i>Hylophilus</i>; both mandibles being notched, and the gape bristly. The metatarsi are usually
  short and robust with slightly united anterior toes, but are longer and more feeble in
  <i>Vireo</i>; the wings may be elongated and pointed, as in <i>Vireosylvia</i>, or abbreviated and
  roundish, as in <i>Vireo</i> and <i>Neochloe</i>; the tail is normally short and even, with narrow
  feathers, but is rounded in <i>Neochloe</i>. The frontal feathers are somewhat erect. The
  coloration is olive, or green and grey above&ndash;with a black, brown, ashy, or reddish
  cap&ndash;and is grey, whitish, or yellow beneath; the wing frequently exhibits white bands, and
  the head white, dusky, or rufous stripes. White or yellow orbital rings occur in <i>Lanivireo</i>,
  a red-brown tail in <i>Hylophilus ochraceiceps</i>, a blue crown in <i>Vireolanius pulchellus</i>,
  a chestnut pectoral band in <i>V. melitophrys</i>. The bill and feet are sometimes red; the eyes
  white, red, or yellow. The sexes frequently differ in colour.</p>

  <p>These active and fearless birds inhabit forests up to an altitude of ten thousand feet, as well
  as ravines, swamps, or even streets of towns; they are usually observed in pairs among the higher
  branches of trees, creeping and hanging to the twigs, or chasing one another about in play. Seldom
  do they seek the ground, but they take fairly long flights, and dart out after passing insects,
  which, with the larvae and a few berries and seeds, form the diet. The continuous song consists of
  loud, reiterated, flute-like notes, supposed in one case to resemble "Whip-Tom-Kelly"; some forms
  also utter harsher chirps or mews. The nest, a deep, firm cup of leaves, grass, bark, lichens,
  spiders'-webs and cottony materials, lined with fibres, fir-needles, delicate stems, or rarely
  down, is supported by some horizontal fork, over which the rim is commonly turned; the four or
  five eggs are white, generally spotted with red-brown, black, or purplish.</p>

  <p>Fam. XVIII. <b>Sittidae.</b>&ndash;The Nuthatches, though closely allied to the <i>Paridae</i>,
  show a certain affinity to the <i>Certhiidae</i> (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page571">571</a></span>). Typically they are stout little birds with long, pointed wings,
  and short nearly square tails; the bill is fairly long and strong, and is straight and awl-like,
  being notched only in <i>Sitella</i> and <i>Hypositta</i>, and slightly upcurved in the
  former.</p>

    </div>

  <p>Bristles usually occur at the gape, while the nostrils are concealed by the same or feathers.
  The metatarsi are short and powerful, the scutes being fused in <i>Hypositta</i>; the hind toe is
  unusually developed; the claws are long, curved, and sharp. The colours in <i>Sitta</i>, which
  ranges over nearly all the Palaearctic and Indian Regions, and throughout North America to Mexico,
  are slaty-blue and rusty-red of various shades, relieved by black and white; the slaty tints
  shewing chiefly above, often in combination with a black or brown cap. <i>Dendrophila</i> and
  <i>Callisitta</i>, of the Indian Region and Timor, are blue and black, with creamy or ochreous
  lower parts. <i>Sitella</i>, of Australia and New Guinea, exhibits brown, grey, black, rufous, and
  white, often having a white head, or a rusty or white wing-patch; <i>Daphoenositta</i>, of the
  latter country, adds to these hues pink at the base of the bill and on the graduated tail;
  <i>Hypositta</i> of Madagascar is greenish-blue, with browner head and under surface, and
  coral-red bill.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page538"><span class="smaller">{538}</span></span></div>

  <p>Nuthatches are quiet, non-migratory birds, which frequent forests or open country with old
  timber, where they may be seen darting quickly from tree to tree with undulating flight, or
  creeping jerkily in Tit-like fashion up and down the trunks or over rocks. They seldom seek their
  food upon the ground, but search every cranny, and dig in rotten wood for insects, their larvae,
  and so forth, or collect nuts, acorns, beech-mast, and seeds; while the nuts are cracked by fixing
  them in chinks and hammering them with the whole weight of the body, which swings backwards and
  forwards from the hip-joint. In winter they are exceedingly tame. The spring call is a noisy,
  querulous "whit-whit," recalling that of the Wryneck, but sibilant sounds and sweeter cries are
  not uncommon, few persons being aware that the British species (<i>Sitta caesia</i>) has at least
  four sets of notes, one of which is very Thrush-like. <i>Sitella</i> has a weak, piping voice. In
  England the nesting-cavity is usually chosen in a tree, but occasionally in a wall, haystack, or
  the like; this is commonly lined with scales from conifer trunks, and the entrance blocked up with
  a plaster of clay pierced by a round hole: abroad, however, holes in rocks are often utilized, and
  nests made of moss, bark, hair, and feathers. The Indian species do not always plaster up their
  holes, and the American apparently never do so. <i>Sitella</i> forms a curious funnel-shaped nest
  with a very thin rim, in forks or on branches, using as materials bark, moss, down, cobwebs, and
  lichens, the bark being applied externally like shingles. The three or four greenish or
  bluish-white eggs, with blackish, grey, or lilac markings, are very unlike those of <i>Sitta</i>,
  which are white, with fine pinkish-red and lilac spots or blotches, and number from five to
  eight.</p>

  <p>Fam. XIX. <b>Paridae.</b>&ndash;The Tits usually have a moderate and slightly decurved bill,
  though it is elongated in <i>Sphenostoma</i> and <i>Certhiparus</i>, abbreviated with roundish
  outline in <i>Acredula</i>, <i>Psaltria</i>, and <i>Psaltriparus</i>, more pointed in
  <i>Aegithalus</i> and <i>Auriparus</i>; the maxilla having little trace of a notch, or the gape of
  bristles. The metatarsi are short, except in <i>Acredula</i>, where the legs are longer and the
  scales tend to fuse; the robust front toes are partially united, and possess strong claws. The
  wings are rounded and abbreviated, especially in <i>Aegithalus</i>; the tail varies considerably,
  being short and nearly square in <i>Parus</i>, long and graduated in <i>Acredula</i> and
  <i>Psaltriparus</i>, intermediate in <i>Psaltria</i> and <i>Sphenostoma</i>, and emarginate in
  <i>Aegithalus</i>. The nostrils, generally hidden <span class="pagenum" id="page539"><span
  class="smaller">{539}</span></span>by bristly feathers, are exposed in <i>Xerophila</i> and
  <i>Sphenostoma</i>. Crests occur in the last-named and at times in <i>Parus</i>.</p>

  <p>The colour of the soft, lax plumage is commonly dull; but <i>Parus</i> may be glossy
  greenish-black and yellow, as in the Sultan-bird (<i>P. sultaneus</i>); black with white on the
  wings, tail, or lower parts, as in <i>P. niger</i> and a few other African species; blue and
  white, with a little black and grey or a yellow fore-neck, as in <i>P. cyanus</i> and <i>P.
  flavipectus</i>; blue, black, greenish, yellow, and white, as in the British Great and Blue Tits
  (<i>P. major</i> and <i>P. caeruleus</i>); olive, brown, or grey, varied with black, white,
  chestnut, or buff, as in our Crested Tit (<i>P. cristatus</i>); or lastly, the tints while
  including but little yellow or blue, as in our Coal and Marsh Tits (<i>P. britannicus</i> and
  <i>P. palustris</i>), may be greyish or olive on the back, with a black head, white cheeks, and
  buffish-white under parts, the former species having a white nuchal patch. <i>Psaltria</i> is
  brown, grey, white, and buff; <i>Psaltriparus</i> is similar; <i>Xerophila</i> and
  <i>Sphenostoma</i> are brown, with yellowish-white, buff, or brown and white lower surface;
  <i>Certhiparus</i> is red-brown, with a grey nape and dull white breast. <i>Acredula</i>,
  containing the Long-tailed Tits, is black and white with a more or less pronounced rosy wash, or
  may be rufous, or brown and grey, with pinkish or fawn under parts, two species having chestnut
  heads. <i>Aegithalus</i> and <i>Auriparus</i> are rufous-brown, yellow-green, or greyish above,
  with black and white, orange-red, or yellow heads; and are commonly rufous and white, yellow, or
  whitish below, occasionally with bay marks. The sexes are very similar, the young often
  yellower.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Titmice are ordinarily non-migratory, <i>Parus</i> occupying most of the globe, except South
  America and the Australian Region east of Lombok and Flores; <i>Psaltria</i> is confined to Java,
  <i>Acredula</i> to the Palaearctic and Indian countries, <i>Aegithalus</i> to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page540"><span class="smaller">{540}</span></span>the same with the Ethiopian
  Region, <i>Psaltriparus</i> and <i>Auriparus</i> to North America, <i>Xerophila</i> and
  <i>Sphenostoma</i> to Australia, <i>Certhiparus</i> to New Zealand.</p>

  <p>These familiar birds, active and often noisy, are found in flat or hilly, open or wooded
  districts, up to an altitude of ten thousand feet or more. They are decidedly arboreal, seldom
  frequenting the ground, and usually combining into flocks, except when breeding. The food consists
  mainly of insects, their eggs, larvae, and pupae, but at times of conifer-seeds, acorns,
  beech-mast, nuts, and the like; while in winter a suspended meat-bone, fat, or crumbs, prove great
  attractions. No doubt a certain amount of fruit is eaten in summer, and buds are plucked in
  spring; but the latter commonly contain injurious grubs. The Great Tit will kill smaller birds.
  The flight is weak and undulating, but on the trees the birds hop, climb, cling head downwards,
  and pry into the crannies in most workman-like style. <i>Xerophila</i> is, however, more
  terrestrial. The sharp reiterated notes are varied by sibilant sounds, those of the Blue Tit being
  fairly representative; yet some are harsher; others, as in the Long-tailed Tits, softer; while
  certain Crested Tits are credited with a song. The nest is normally a mass of moss&ndash;and
  sometimes grass&ndash;with a felted lining of wool, hair, or fur, containing from five or six to
  twelve or more white eggs, which are in most cases spotted or freckled with various shades of red,
  but rarely with purplish or chocolate-colour. Sometimes more than one is laid in a day. The fabric
  is placed in holes in trees, stumps, rocks, walls, or the ground; pumps, post-boxes, and so forth
  are frequently selected: nooks behind loose bark, deserted habitations of other birds, or the
  foundations of those of Hawks and Crows are sometimes chosen; while <i>Sphenostoma</i>, and
  occasionally <i>Xerophila</i>, build open nests in shrubs. <i>Acredula</i>, <i>Aegithalus</i>, and
  <i>Psaltriparus</i> make a purse-shaped structure with an entrance near the top; the first-named,
  thence called Bottle-Tit, placing it in hedges, bushes, undergrowth, forks of trees, or even ivy,
  and using as materials, moss, wool, lichens, and cobwebs, with a thick feather-lining; the two
  latter generally suspend it to branches and fashion it of grass, fibres, and leaves, often adding
  twigs externally or down internally. <i>Aegithalus</i> occasionally makes a tubular passage.
  <i>Auriparus</i> deposits in a similar or bulkier nest pale bluish or greenish eggs with red-brown
  specks, while those of <i>Sphenostoma</i> are blue with blackish <span class="pagenum"
  id="page541"><span class="smaller">{541}</span></span>markings. <i>Acredula</i> apparently
  incubates with its tail over its back. The hen's bravery when sitting, her hissing challenge, and
  her speedy return when driven off, are characteristic of Tits.</p>

  <p>Fam. XX. <b>Panuridae.</b>&ndash;Family rank is now pretty generally accorded to <i>Panurus
  biarmicus</i>, the "Bearded Tit" or "Reed-Pheasant," though its affinities are still doubtful. Dr.
  Gadow,<a id="NtA_289" href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a> judging from the internal structure,
  inclines to the view that it is akin to the Finches, but others place it next to the Tits. The
  bill is short, curved, rather conical, and without a notch; the metatarsus is long and scutellated
  anteriorly; the wings are short and rounded, the tail is extremely long and graduated. The plumage
  is orange-brown above, with a grey crown and a black streak from the lores down the cheeks, where
  the feathers are elongated and point backwards; the wings are varied with black and white; the
  throat is greyish, the breast pinkish; the abdomen coloured like the back; the under tail-coverts
  are black, the bill is yellow. The hen has a buff head, while she lacks the black "moustache" and
  under tail-coverts.</p>

  <p>This pretty species, which ranges through most of Europe, except Scandinavia and Northern
  Russia, and reaches Central Asia, may be seen to advantage on the Norfolk Broads, where it is
  resident, and still breeds in diminished numbers. In windy weather the separate pairs keep hidden,
  but at other times, though shy, a quiet observer may see them flitting above the reeds, uttering
  their clear "ping-ping," or clinging to the flowering tops. Insects and small molluscs, with seeds
  in winter, constitute the food. From April to August a nest of broad grasses, sedges, and the
  like, lined with reed-flowers, or exceptionally with vegetable-down, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page542"><span class="smaller">{542}</span></span>is built in aquatic herbage, or rarely in
  moderately high plants, to contain the round creamy eggs with sparing brownish-black lines and
  scrawls. These number from four to eight, or even ten, should two hens lay together. The
  alarm-note is plaintive. Towards autumn the adults and young form large flocks.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXI. <b>Oriolidae.</b>&ndash;The Old World Orioles, not to be confounded with the
  so-called "American Orioles" (<i>Icteridae</i>), inhabit the Palaearctic, Indian, and Australian
  Regions, reaching eastward to Turkestan, China, and Papuasia. The bill is strong, rather long,
  straight, and notched, or, in <i>Sphecotheres</i>, curved; the metatarsus is short, the toes are
  small, the wings are long, the tail is moderate and slightly rounded. <i>Sphecotheres</i> has
  naked lores and orbits. The Golden Oriole (<i>O. galbula</i>) which breeds exceptionally in
  England, is orange-yellow, with black lores and mainly black wings and tail; the similar Indian
  Mango-bird (<i>O. kundoo</i>), has a black post-ocular streak; other species shew black napes or
  heads. <i>O. viridis</i> and its allies are olive-yellow or brownish, often with dusky streaks,
  <i>O. steerii</i> being white beneath with broad black stripes; <i>O. cruentus</i> is blue-black,
  with crimson wing-bar and mid-breast; <i>O. ardens</i> chiefly crimson, with black head and
  fore-neck; <i>O. trailli</i> maroon, with black head, throat, and wings; <i>O. hosii</i> black,
  with <span class="pagenum" id="page543"><span class="smaller">{543}</span></span>chestnut under
  tail-coverts. The bill is crimson, pinkish, or bluish. <i>Sphecotheres</i> is yellow-green or
  olive-yellow, at times brighter below, and is relieved by black, grey, and white, the orbits being
  yellowish or flesh-coloured, the bill blackish.</p>

  <p>These shy, restless, and quarrelsome birds frequent gardens, groves, and mangrove swamps,
  avoiding the ground, flying heavily but swiftly from tree to tree, and hopping among the higher
  branches. They eat insects and fruit; and utter flute-like notes, varied by mewing calls or
  "churrs" of alarm. The nest is a pocket of bark, grass, and fibres, with the rim woven over two
  forking twigs&ndash;leaves, moss, and hair being occasionally added. The three to five white or
  salmon-coloured eggs have dark purplish or brown-pink spots, and more rarely streaks; those of
  <i>Oriolus viridis</i> being more dusky with brown and lilac markings. <i>Sphecotheres
  maxillaris</i> makes a shallow nest of twigs, and lays three olive or green eggs, blotched or
  zoned with red-brown.<a id="NtA_290" href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fam. XXII. <b>Paradiseidae.</b>&ndash;The Birds of Paradise have no rivals in splendour, unless
  it be the Humming-birds, among which, however, there is no such marvellous development of
  accessory plumes. They are undoubtedly allied to the Corvidae, as is evidenced in particular by
  <i>Lycocorax</i> and <i>Manucodia</i>, while these also connect the more typical forms with the
  comparatively plainly garbed Bower-birds, often placed in a separate Family,
  <i>Ptilorhynchidae</i>. Few species are as large as Crows, and some are not bigger than Thrushes.
  Whether known to earlier traders or not, the first undoubted account of Birds of Paradise
  published in Europe was that of Maximilianus Transylvanus (1523), followed by that of Antonio
  Pigafetta, both relating to a couple of birds brought by Magellan's company from Batchian,<a
  id="NtA_291" href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> where they were called Manukdewata, or "Birds of
  the gods." Natives when preserving the skins used to cut off the wings and the feet, a fact which
  gave rise to absurd stories of Paradise-birds (<i>Paradisea apoda</i>) never perching, gazing
  perpetually at the sun (<i>passaros de sol</i>), suspending themselves by the tail-feathers, and
  so forth. The hen was also said to lay her eggs on the back of her spouse.</p>

      <i>Drepanornis albertisi.</i> &times; &#x2156;. (From <i>Nature</i>).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The bill is usually short and stout, but is Crow-like in <i>Manucodia</i> and <i>Lycocorax</i>,
  long and decurved in <i>Ptilorhis</i>, <i>Paryphephorus</i>, <i>Ianthothorax</i>,
  <i>Seleucides</i>, and <i>Falcinellus</i>, and becomes slender and sickle-shaped in
  <i>Drepanornis</i>; the maxilla is in some cases notched, and in <i>Scenopoeetes</i> bidentate.
  The metatarsi are strong and fairly long, the outer and middle toes are slightly united, and the
  hallux is large. The wings are moderate or short, being especially rounded in Bower-birds; the
  tail may be enormously elongated and graduated, as in both sexes of <i>Falcinellus</i>,
  <i>Astrapia</i>, and <i>Paradigalla</i>; less graduated and shorter, as in <i>Drepanornis</i>; of
  medium length, <span class="pagenum" id="page545"><span class="smaller">{545}</span></span>and
  square or rounded, as in many forms; or much abbreviated, as in <i>Cicinnurus</i>. <i>Astrapia
  stephaniae</i> has the two median rectrices concave and decurved over; those feathers in the males
  of <i>Paradisea</i>, <i>Cicinnurus</i>, <i>Diphyllodes</i>, <i>Schlegelia</i>,
  <i>Paradisornis</i>, and <i>Uranornis</i> exhibiting more or less wire-like shafts, which
  terminate in large racquets in <i>Cicinnurus</i>, smaller discs in <i>Paradisornis</i>. They are
  broader, convex above, wavy, and horny in <i>Uranornis</i>, and are curled outwardly in
  <i>Diphyllodes</i> and <i>Schlegelia</i>, while they cross each other twice in the last, but once
  in <i>Cicinnurus</i>. <i>Pteridophora</i> has an extraordinary streamer behind each eye. That
  these however, are by no means the only remarkable developments, will be seen from the following
  descriptions of the most striking species, all of which are confined to Papuasia and Australia,
  except the Moluccan genera <i>Semioptera</i> and <i>Lycocorax</i>. The feathering often extends
  over part of the bill.</p>

  <p><i>Manucodia</i> and <i>Phonygammus</i> are the only Passerine birds known to have a convoluted
  trachea.<a id="NtA_292" href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Ptilorhis paradisea</i>, the Rifleman-bird,<a id="NtA_293"
  href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a> is velvety-black with a purple gloss, having the head, throat,
  and median rectrices green, the abdomen bronzy; the crown-feathers are scale-like, and the silky
  flank-plumes considerably elongated. <i>P. magnifica</i> is somewhat similarly coloured, with a
  stiff pectoral shield of metallic green; <i>Ianthothorax</i> and <i>Paryphephorus</i>, with
  erectile nuchal collars, are near allies. <i>Seleucides ignotus</i> the Twelve-wired Bird of
  Paradise, which has six long, recurved and filiform appendages to the lax, projecting feathers of
  each side, is black, with purplish head, wings, and tail, bronzy back, broad erectile
  breast-plumes margined with emerald, yellow sides and belly. <i>Drepanornis albertisi</i> is
  rufous-brown, with green throat and ante-ocular region, white belly and dusky breast; the sides of
  the last exhibit dark-edged bronzy plumes, which can be expanded like a fan, succeeded by long
  grey decomposed feathers with lilac margins; and small bluish tufts surmount the bare orbits and
  post-ocular region. <i>Falcinellus speciosus</i> is black with rainbow-like reflexions; the broad
  plumes of the sides of the upper breast being banded with metallic blue and green, and having wide
  tips which open upwards into a fan; while the long pointed flank-feathers compose similarly
  coloured tufts.</p>

  <p><i>Astrapia nigra</i>, the Paradise-Pie of old authors, is bronzy-black above and green below,
  with golden-green occiput and nape, purplish black throat, coppery fore-neck, and violet tail, the
  feathers round the head forming an erectile frill. <i>A. stephaniae</i> has the head and neck
  bluer, the breast purplish-bronze. The smaller <i>A. splendidissima</i> has a more brilliant
  nape-region, red fore-neck, and much buff on the tail. <i>Macgregoria pulchra</i> is black, with
  mainly orange-buff primaries, and an orange wattle covering most of the face. <i>Paradigalla
  carunculata</i> is black, with green and bronzy sheen above; the front of the head being naked,
  with three wattles on each side&ndash;one broad and yellow above the bill, another moderate and
  blue at the gape, a third small and red below it. <i>Paradisea apoda</i>, the Great Bird of
  Paradise, is rich brown, becoming purplish beneath; the head and neck are pale yellow, the
  forehead, lores, cheeks, and throat metallic green. The wiry median rectrices have very slight
  apical and basal webs, while long, thick, extensile tufts of delicate decomposed golden-orange
  feathers, tipped with brown, grace the sides. Of its congeners, <i>P. minor</i> has the mantle
  straw-coloured; <i>P. raggiana</i> has a light yellow gorget, and red lateral plumes like those of
  <i>P.</i> (<i>Uranornis</i>) <i>rubra</i>, the Red Bird of Paradise. <i>P.</i>
  (<i>Paradisornis</i>) <i>rudolphi</i> is greenish-blue and dusky above, with blackish head, neck,
  and under surface, and a purplish occipital patch. From the sides of the body spring two series of
  elongated, decomposed feathers; the outer and stiffer being ultramarine, changing terminally to
  lilac with a brown external tinge, the inner smaller and deeper blue. Below these come a row of
  short chestnut plumes and finally a set of black. The two long median rectrices are violet-black
  with small blue racquet-tips.</p>

  <p><i>Cicinnurus regius</i>, the King Bird of Paradise, hardly seven inches long, is glossy
  crimson, with a metallic green band dividing the throat from the white lower parts. An expansible
  fan of ashy plumes tipped with emerald arises from each side, while the long median tail-wires
  have the terminal green inner webs coiled into discs. The feathering reaches far down the orange
  bill; the feet are cobalt, contrasting with the black, yellowish, or fleshy tints usual in the
  Family. <i>Diphyllodes gulielmi tertii</i> is orange-red with mainly dusky wings and tail; the
  long nuchal ruff being orange, the lateral neck-tufts purplish-brown, the pectoral shield green
  edged with emerald, the long side-plumes brown with green ends, the belly purple. <i>D.
  magnifica</i> has a brown head and under surface, green throat and breast-shield, orange-brown
  back surmounted by a double cape of straw-yellow upon red-brown, and long, curved steel-blue
  tail-wires. <i>Schlegelia respublica</i> is remarkable for its naked blue head, with two lines of
  brown feathers crossing each other at right angles, and for its blue feet. The upper parts are
  successively green, yellow, crimson, black, and brown; the silky gular shield is green, with
  metallic blue spots above and coppery marks below; the lateral breast-plumes shew coppery and
  green hues. <i>Parotia sexpennis</i>, the Six-wired Bird of Paradise, is bronzy- and
  purplish-black, having scale-like golden throat- and breast-feathers with green and blue
  reflexions. A satiny white <span class="pagenum" id="page548"><span
  class="smaller">{548}</span></span>patch crosses the forehead; the occiput is green, blue, and
  purple, having two lateral tufts, from each of which spring three wires terminating in small black
  discs; while large, soft, erectile masses of black adorn each side of the body. <i>Semioptera
  wallacii</i>, the Standard-wing, is mouse-coloured, with somewhat bronzy back and violet head; the
  pectoral feathers have green edges; the green shield on the fore-neck extends in lateral tufts to
  the flanks; and two long, narrow white plumes, erected at will, adorn the bend of each wing.
  <i>Lophorhina superba</i> is black, with blue, green, and bronzy gloss on the head and neck; the
  bluish-green breast-shield is prolonged at the sides, and a metallic black erectile ruff graces
  the nape. <i>Lamprothorax</i> has coppery, green, purple, rosy, and brownish hues, and two long
  blue-green median rectrices. <i>Phonygammus jamesi</i> is purplish-violet, with blue-green head,
  under surface, lanceolate neck-feathers, and acuminate occipital tufts. The extraordinary
  <i>Pteridophora alberti</i> possesses a wonderful streamer behind each eye, twice as long as the
  body. This has, on the outer side only, about thirty-seven thin quadrangular enamel-like lobes,
  which are light blue with dusky backs. The plumage is black, with olive rump-region and ochraceous
  lower parts, the head and neck shewing elongated plumes.</p>

  <p><i>Manucodia atra</i> is steel-green and black, with purple reflexions; <i>M.</i>
  (<i>Eucorax</i>) <i>comrii</i> has the head and neck-feathers curly, <i>M. chalybeata</i> those of
  the fore-neck. The Crow-like <i>Lycocorax pyrrhopterus</i> is greenish-black with brown wings;
  <i>Xanthomelus aureus</i> is orange-yellow, and has a deeper-coloured crested head and neck, black
  throat, tail, and part of wings and back, and a cape of hackled plumes falling over the last.</p>

  <p>Of the Bower-birds, <i>Prionodura newtoniana</i> is bright orange, olive, and brown;
  <i>Cnemophilus macgregori</i> is golden-yellow above and black below, with brownish wings and
  tail; the thin recurved <span class="pagenum" id="page549"><span
  class="smaller">{549}</span></span>crest merging into a compressed frontal ridge, whence chestnut
  feathering extends over the culmen. <i>Loria loriae</i> is chiefly purplish-black with an
  iridescent violet nasal shield of scale-like feathers. <i>Loboparadisea sericea</i> is
  rufous-brown and yellow, with a wattle, apparently bluish, extending upwards from the gape on each
  side. <i>Amblyornis inornata</i> and <i>A. subalaris</i> are respectively olive and reddish-brown,
  with a huge orange-red crest. <i>A. flavifrons</i> has the crest yellower. <i>Sericulus
  melinus</i>, the Regent-bird, is black, with orange head, neck, and most of the remiges;
  <i>Ptilorhynchus violaceus</i>, the Satin-bird, is purplish-black, with much feathered culmen;
  <i>Scenopoeetes dentirostris</i> is olive-brown above, and fulvous with dusky streaks below.
  <i>Aeluredus viridis</i>, the Cat-bird, not to be confounded with that of America (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page519">519</a></span>), is bright green, with a blue wash on the back,
  and with white streaks, bars, or spots on the nape, wings, tail, and yellowish under parts. Other
  species of the genus have mainly black or brown heads, while some have white throats with black
  markings. <i>Chlamydodera nuchalis</i> has grey-brown plumage above with whitish tips, a lilac
  nuchal band backed by stiff feathers, and a yellow-grey lower surface.</p>

  <p>Female Paradise-birds generally have brown upper parts with lighter markings, though they are
  occasionally blacker, as in <i>Astrapia</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page550"><span
  class="smaller">{550}</span></span>and <i>Paradigalla</i>; below the colour is rufous, buff, grey,
  yellowish or white, with bars, stripes, or chevrons of blackish or brown. In the female of
  <i>Schlegelia</i> the bare head is duller than in the male, while a little red and gold shews
  above; the hen of <i>Ptilorhynchus</i> exhibits grey-green and brown tints; the sexes are almost
  alike in <i>Phonygammus</i>, <i>Manucodia</i>, <i>Lycocorax</i>, and <i>Aeluredus</i>; in
  <i>Paradisornis</i> the female has blue wings and tail. Young birds usually resemble their mother;
  but with regard to their progress to maturity, the elongation and abrasion of the webs of the
  median rectrices, and the growth of the decorative tufts, the works of Mr. Wallace,<a id="NtA_294"
  href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> Dr. Guillemard,<a id="NtA_295"
  href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> and Mr. Rothschild<a id="NtA_296"
  href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a> should be consulted.</p>

  <p>Except in the Bower-birds the habits vary but little. Paradise-birds are lively and active, shy
  though curious, taking refuge in the thick foliage when disturbed; small flocks are not
  unfrequently observed, usually of one species, while for considerable periods the males appear to
  live apart. Closely wooded hills and ravines are the chief resorts, <i>Falcinellus</i>,
  <i>Astrapia</i>, <i>Lophorhina</i>, <i>Diphyllodes</i>, and the like preferring the inland heights
  of New Guinea up to an altitude of about nine thousand feet; <i>Parotia</i> of that country and
  <i>Scenopoeetes</i> of Queensland range to about four thousand feet; but such forms as
  <i>Cicinnurus</i>, <i>Xanthomelus</i>, <i>Phonygammus</i>, <i>Ptilorhis</i>, and the Australian
  Cat-birds and Bower-birds, occupy lower elevations on the coast or elsewhere. <i>Falcinellus</i>,
  <i>Astrapia</i>, <i>Paradisea</i>, <i>Parotia</i>, <i>Ptilorhis</i>, <i>Sericulus</i>, and
  doubtless others, love high tree-tops; <i>Semioptera</i>, <i>Cicinnurus</i>, and so forth, live
  nearer to the ground. The brief flight is rapid, though undulating and often heavy; in
  <i>Cicinnurus</i> it is noisy, in <i>Ptilorhis</i> the sound produced resembles the rustling of
  silk. Most species hop constantly about the boughs; <i>Paradigalla</i> often rests on dead trees;
  <i>Drepanornis</i>, <i>Seleucides</i>, <i>Semioptera</i>, and <i>Ptilorhis</i>, search under the
  bark for insects, and move about like Creepers. The pugnacious males of <i>Paradisea</i> collect
  to "dance" on favourite trees at the breeding season, when they fly about with elevated and
  vibrating plumes; while in the Family generally the cock courts the hen in Pigeon-like fashion,
  <i>Diphyllodes</i> making meanwhile a complete circle of its expanded mantle- and throat-plumes.
  <i>Parotia</i> scratches and rolls in the dust like a Fowl.</p>

  <p>The voice may be a shrill reiterated "wake-wake," as in <i>Paradisea</i>; a harsh or sonorous
  cry, as in <i>Falcinellus</i>, <i>Chlamydodera</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page551"><span
  class="smaller">{551}</span></span><i>Phonygammus</i>, <i>Ptilorhynchus</i>, <i>Sericulus</i>,
  <i>Seleucides</i>, and <i>Semioptera</i>; a long, grating or triple sound, as in <i>Ptilorhis</i>;
  a mewing or flute-like note, as in <i>Cicinnurus</i>; or a sharp whistle, as in <i>Aeluredus</i>;
  the last-named and <i>Amblyornis</i> being especially excellent mimics. The diet consists largely
  of berries, seeds, fruits of <i>Pandanus</i>, and <i>Freycinetia</i>, the fig, nutmeg, and so
  forth; frogs, lizards, worms, snails, and caterpillars, however, are also eaten; insects are in
  great request; and <i>Seleucides</i> sucks honey from the flowers. The nest and eggs of several
  species have now been discovered; the former being a loose, open fabric of sticks and leaves in
  <i>Ptilorhis</i>, <i>Ptilorhynchus</i>, <i>Sericulus</i>, and <i>Phonygammus</i>; or of twigs,
  roots, moss, and grass in <i>Eucorax</i>, <i>Chlamydodera</i>, <i>Prionodura</i>,
  <i>Aeluredus</i>, and <i>Drepanornis</i>; it is placed in bushes, if not in low or even high
  trees. The eggs are glossy reddish-buff, with dark rufous or chestnut blotches and streaks, and a
  few black spots, in <i>Paradisea apoda</i>, <i>P. augustae victoriae</i>, <i>P. raggiana</i>, and
  <i>Ptilorhis victoriae</i>; similar or whiter, often with purplish or purplish-grey markings in
  <i>Eucorax, Manucodia</i>, and <i>Drepanornis cervinicauda</i>; yellower with additional wavy
  scrolling in <i>Ptilorhynchus violaceus</i>; yellowish-grey with pale brown freckles and blotches
  in <i>Prionodura newtoniana</i>; bluish or greenish-white, with or without red-brown dots and
  lines, in <i>Aeluredus maculosus</i> and <i>Ae. viridis</i>; greenish-white with a network of
  narrow brown and black lines in <i>Chlamydodera maculata</i> and <i>C. cerviniventris</i>; pale
  lavender with sienna and lilac spots and scrawls in <i>Sericulus melinus</i>. The number of eggs
  found varies from one to three.</p>

  <p><i>Parotia lawesi</i>, <i>Aeluredus viridis</i> and <i>Scenopoeetes dentirostris</i>, though
  not said to form bowers, make clear spaces where from six to eight males meet to sport, the last
  two species decorating them with green or coloured leaves, berries, and flowers. <i>Prionodura</i>
  fashions a bower or play-place of from four to six feet high by eight broad, piling sticks round
  two trees and roofing over the intervening space with creepers; white moss, ferns, and green fruit
  serving as ornaments. Small structures of over-arching grass capped with twigs are often
  observable close by. <i>Amblyornis inornata</i> heaps a cone of moss round a sapling, leaving a
  circular gallery between this and an outer conical cover of sticks two feet high, covered with
  orchid sprays. Before the entrance lies a bed of green moss decked with bright flowers and
  berries, which are renewed daily, the withered decorations being piled at <span class="pagenum"
  id="page552"><span class="smaller">{552}</span></span>the back. <i>A. subalaris</i> fashions a
  domed bower of sticks and moss, with one or two openings, round a shrub which is itself entwined
  with twigs; the centre of the floor shewing a cheese-like mass of moss ornamented with flowers and
  seeds. <i>Sericulus melinus</i> builds a run about a foot long on a platform of sticks, composing
  it of arched twigs and decorating it with shells, berries, and leaves. <i>Ptilorhynchus
  violaceus</i> makes a like structure of twigs and grass, which scarcely meet above, and adorns it
  with bright feathers; scattering other feathers, bones, shells, rags, berries, and the like over
  the space which Bower-birds habitually clear in front. In <i>Chlamydodera nuchalis</i> the similar
  bower, about three feet long, is lined with grasses, a large heap of ornaments lying before each
  entrance.</p>

  <p>Paradise-birds are shot with blunt arrows, snared, caught in nets, in cloths, or with
  bird-lime; they have been kept in captivity by the Zoological Society of London, and in Italy.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXIII. <b>Corvidae.</b>&ndash;The Crows and their kin compose a fairly uniform tribe,
  often divided into the Sub-families <i>Corvinae</i> (Crows), <i>Garrulinae</i> (Magpies and Jays),
  and <i>Fregilinae</i> (Choughs).</p>

  <p>The bill is generally stout and fairly straight, with no distinct notch, being very strong in
  <i>Corvultur</i> and <i>Corvus corax</i>, but more or less curved in <i>Gazzola</i>,
  <i>Microcorax</i>, <i>Macrocorax</i>, <i>Urocissa</i>, <i>Garrulus</i>, <i>Callaeas</i>
  (<i>Glaucopis</i>), <i>Struthidea</i>, and <i>Pyrrhocorax</i>; while in the last-named and
  <i>Heterocorax</i> it is exceptionally long and slender, and in <i>Nucifraga</i> subulate and of
  diverse proportions. The metatarsus is usually strong; the wings are long and pointed in Crows and
  Choughs, shorter in Jays and Magpies, and decidedly rounded in <i>Corcorax</i>, <i>Callaeas</i>,
  and <i>Struthidea</i>. The variable tail is very long and much graduated in <i>Pica</i>,
  <i>Cyanopica</i>, <i>Urocissa</i>, <i>Cryptorhina</i>, <i>Dendrocitta</i>, <i>Crypsirhina</i>,
  <i>Cissa</i>, and <i>Calocitta</i>, the two median rectrices often exceeding the others; but it is
  usually moderate, though at the same time graduated in some Jays.</p>

  <p>Crests occur in <i>Cyanocitta</i>, <i>Platysmurus</i>, <i>Cyanocorax</i>, <i>Uroleuca</i>, and
  <i>Calocitta</i>, those of the last two being recurved, and <i>Calocitta</i> having the plumes
  widened; sometimes the crown-feathers are dense and erectile, as in <i>Garrulus</i>. The head of
  <i>Picathartes</i> is bare and yellow, with a broad black patch behind each eye; <i>Gymnocorax</i>
  shews a large yellowish or whitish naked space on the face; the adult Rook (<i>Corvus
  frugilegus</i>) has whitish skin over the forehead, lores, and throat; in <i>C. pastinator</i> the
  throat is feathered. <i>Pica mauritanica</i> has a blue, and the yellow-billed <span
  class="pagenum" id="page553"><span class="smaller">{553}</span></span><i>P. nuttalli</i> a yellow,
  ear-patch; <i>Cissa</i> a fleshy vermilion orbital outgrowth; <i>Callaeas</i> an orange rictal
  wattle with blue base in one species, a blue wattle in the other.</p>

  <p>This Family occupies nearly all the globe, except the Australian Region east of the Sandwich
  Islands, New Caledonia, and New Zealand; while the members are less plentiful in America, and from
  Panama to Uruguay only a few genera akin to the Jay occur. The sexes are similar, the young
  usually duller.</p>

  <p>True Crows are generally black with a purplish or greenish gloss, and frequently with white at
  the base of the feathers; some, however, are browner, while the silvery-grey hind-neck of the
  Jackdaw and the grey back and lower parts of the "Hooded" Crow are well known. The Chinese
  <i>Corvus torquatus</i> and the Ethiopian <i>C. scapulatus</i> have white collars behind, and
  white on the breast; in <i>Gazzola</i> of Celebes that colour extends further; but the African
  <i>Corvultur</i> has the white collar only. The throat sometimes exhibits hackles, and in the
  Antillean <i>Microcorax leucognaphalus</i> the feathers have hair-like extremities. Our visitor
  the Nutcracker (<i>Nucifraga caryocatactes</i>) is brown, with whitish dorsal and pectoral spots,
  and blackish quills; three or four other species of the genus, with most variable bills, inhabit
  conifer woods in the Palaearctic Region; and a near ally (<i>Picicorvus columbianus</i>) those of
  the western Rocky Mountains. Choughs (<i>Pyrrhocorax</i>), which occur in the Palaearctic and the
  extreme north of the Ethiopian Region, are glossy black, with brilliant red feet, and red or
  yellow bill.</p>

  <p><i>Pica rustica</i>, the well-known Magpie, needs no description, nor do its black and white
  congeners, <i>P. mauritanica</i>, distinguished by a naked blue spot behind the eye, and <i>P.
  nuttalli</i> with this spot and the beak yellow. <i>P. rustica</i> extends through the Palaearctic
  Region, and reaches Formosa and North America; the other species are found respectively in Algeria
  and Morocco and in California. <i>Platysmurus aterrimus</i> of Borneo, and <i>Temnurus
  truncatus</i> of Cochin China are instances of uniform glossy black forms in this section;
  <i>Psilorhinus</i>, from the centre of America, is a dull brown Jay. <i>Cyanopica cooki</i>, of
  Southern Spain, represented in Eastern Asia and Japan by <i>C. cyana</i>, is a blue Magpie, having
  cobalt wings and tail, an ashy body, and a black head; while the Indo-Chinese and Sumatran genus,
  <i>Dendrocitta</i>, shews brown, orange, buff, and grey tints, mingled with black and usually
  white. <i>Cissa</i> contains three species from India, Burma, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page554"><span class="smaller">{554}</span></span>Sumatra, and Java, of lovely green and blue,
  or cobalt and ultramarine hues, with some red-brown on the wing, a white tip to the tail,
  coral-red bill and feet, and&ndash;in two cases&ndash;a black nape. Our soft-plumaged Jay
  (<i>Garrulus glandarius</i>), with its black and white crest and wings, black tail, reddish-fawn
  upper and buff under parts, and patch of blue, white and black bars on the wing-coverts, may
  represent a genus ranging over the Palaearctic Region, and through the Himalayas, to the Burmese
  districts and Formosa. In Japan alone four species are found. <i>Aphelocoma</i> and
  <i>Calocitta</i> of the central parts of the New World; the Blue Jays (<i>Cyanocitta</i>) of North
  America; <i>Urocissa</i>, a Magpie with red or yellow bill and feet, from India, Burma, and China;
  and the Central and South American <i>Cyanocorax</i>, all shew more blue than <i>Garrulus</i>, not
  uncommonly on the under surface. <i>Perisoreus infaustus</i>, the Siberian Jay, is brown, grey,
  and olive, with much chestnut on the wings, tail, and abdomen, its congeners being plain brown,
  grey, and white. Lastly, <i>Xanthura luxuosa</i>, the Green Jay of South Texas and Mexico, is
  green, with yellow on the abdomen and lateral rectrices, and a black and blue head; some species
  of the genus, which reaches southwards to Venezuela and Bolivia, having the lower surface entirely
  yellow or black, and others being almost blue with black on the head.</p>

  <p>The habits of the cunning voracious Crows, the gregarious Rooks, the astute but bold Magpies
  and Jackdaws, and the more shy or retiring Jays and Choughs are well known; yet the habit of
  posting sentinels in the Rook, the tumbling in mid-air of that bird, the Raven, and the Jackdaw,
  the scolding pursuit of intruders by Magpies and Jays, and the breaking of clams, bones, and the

  <p>Crows generally inhabit wooded country, but also bare moorlands or sea-coasts; the Nutcracker
  requires pine-forests&ndash;commonly at considerable elevations; and Magpies haunt woods, yet not
  so invariably as Jays. The whole Family hop, and most forms, except perhaps Jays, walk or run
  also. All are active birds and fly well, the Chough, Jay, and Nutcracker in more undulating
  fashion: while soaring is a common practice. Ravens have very deep voices, and croak, "bark," or
  "grunt"; Jackdaws utter a clear jake-jake; Choughs a ringing, metallic note or a hoarse
  "chough-chough"; Nutcrackers a "churr-churr"; Magpies a continuous rattle or "chatter." Jays vary
  their harsh, grating utterances by mimicking other species, the American Blue Jays being notorious
  adepts, and exhibiting meanwhile fantastic contortions of the head, wings, and tail. Many species,
  such as Ravens, Magpies, and Jackdaws, learn to imitate sounds when tamed. The Corvidae <span
  class="pagenum" id="page556"><span class="smaller">{556}</span></span>are almost omnivorous,
  Ravens and other strong species even attacking weakly ewes or lambs, and preying on small mammals,
  birds, and reptiles; Hooded and Carrion Crows, Rooks, Magpies. Jackdaws, and Jays suck eggs; while
  Rooks, though undoubtedly beneficial, also grub up seed-corn and potatoes. An immense amount of
  insect-life is, however, destroyed, and the larger forms dispose of carrion; the American
  <i>Corvus ossifragus</i> and <i>C. corone</i>, moreover, will catch living fish. Magpies and Jays
  feed largely upon the ground, and eat slugs, snails, worms, insects, nuts, acorns, grain, seeds of
  conifers, and other fruits; Nutcrackers devour quantities of the last; <i>Corvus tropicus</i>,
  <i>Macrocorax</i>, and <i>Gymnocorax</i> relish fruit. Jays store provisions, and Jackdaws pick
  insects off cattle. The nests of Crows and Nutcrackers are bulky structures of sticks, lined with
  soft materials; the rough domed fabric of the Magpie is neatly lined with roots upon a layer of
  clay; the slighter nests of Choughs and Jays are inlaid with roots and fibres&ndash;more rarely
  with moss, hair, or wool&ndash;and every variety is found between these limits. The larger species
  build in forks and holes in trees, in crevices of rocks and masonry, or rarely in or on the
  ground; the Chough never chooses trees; Jays nest comparatively low, and often in bushes. Crows'
  eggs are normally greenish, mottled with darker green, olive, or brownish, but <i>Heterocorax
  capensis</i> has them pinkish with red spots, while other Crows, Ravens, and <i>Dendrocitta</i>
  sometimes shew a similar tint. Jackdaws' eggs are bluish-green or white, with dark olive or black
  markings interspersed with grey; those of Magpies and Nutcrackers have a like ground-colour with
  greenish-olive and faint brownish spots respectively; those of Jays are greenish, or even bluish,
  with close olive-green frecklings or zones, and occasional black scrawls at the larger end; those
  of Choughs are yellowish-white, with light brown and grey markings. The number laid varies from
  two or three, to as many as nine in Magpies, but is usually four or five. The hens sit rather
  closely. Ravens sometimes will even attack man at the nest.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Of genera doubtfully included in the Family, <i>Picathartes</i> of the Gold Coast is
  slaty-grey, with brown quills, white under parts, and bare yellow head, shewing black behind each
  eye; it builds among rocks near forest-streams, and feeds upon reptiles and molluscs. The egg is
  whitish, clouded and dotted with brown. <i>Callaeas</i> (<i>Glaucopis</i>) <i>cinerea</i>, which
  is blue-grey, with black on the head, and an orange and blue rictal wattle, and its congener <i>C.
  wilsoni</i>, with entirely blue wattle, inhabit the lower hill-forests of the South and North
  Islands of New Zealand respectively. They have deep, rich, long-drawn notes, diversified by
  "cackles," mews, or "bell-like" sounds, the male performing antics when courting. The food
  consists of fruit, flowers, and insects; the flight is feeble. The large nests of twigs, moss, and
  grass are placed in trees; the two or three eggs being purplish-grey with brown blotches or
  frecklings. <i>Corcorax</i> and <i>Struthidea</i> are peculiar to Australia, the former being
  glossy black with white on the wing, the latter brownish-grey with black tail.<a id="NtA_297"
  href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> <i>Corcorax</i> haunts open forests, brook-sides, and lagoons
  in little flocks, running about actively, or leaping upon the boughs with motile, outspread tail.
  The food consists of insects; the note is grating or mournful; while <span class="pagenum"
  id="page558"><span class="smaller">{558}</span></span>the male courts the female like a Pigeon.
  The nest, a sort of basin of mud with a straw lining, is fixed on a horizontal branch, and
  contains from four to seven yellowish-white eggs with olive and purplish-brown markings.
  <i>Struthidea</i> frequents pine tracts, and has similar habits and nest, the eggs being white
  with red-brown and grey blotches. In <i>Heteralocha<a id="NtA_298"
  href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> acutirostris</i>, the New Zealand Huia, the female has a
  remarkably long, curved bill, that of the male being short, stout, and nearly straight. The
  plumage is greenish-black, with a white-tipped tail; the bill is whitish, the feet are blue-grey,
  the large rictal wattles orange. This bird frequents wooded gullies in the North Island, seldom
  flying above the foliage, but bounding or hopping along the ground or upon the branches. Natives
  attract and noose it by imitating the whistling note. The cock chisels away the decayed bark, and
  the hen probes the crevices for insects; "huhu" caterpillars and berries varying the main diet.
  The nest, of dry grass, leaves, and stalks, is placed in hollow trees, the eggs being apparently
  whitish, with or without brown and grey spots. <i>Creadion carunculatus</i>, the Saddle-back of
  the same country, is black, with chestnut back, rump, wing- and tail-coverts, and small yellow or
  red gape-wattles. It haunts wooded hills, hopping actively or moving spirally up the trunks and
  branches, while the flight is short, rapid, and laboured. The notes may be soft and sweet, or
  noisy and shrill; the food resembles that of <i>Heteralocha</i>. The nest of dry leaves, ferns,
  fibres, moss, and bark is built in hollow trees or large ferns, the three or four greyish-white
  eggs shewing purplish-brown markings.</p>

  <p><i>Podoces</i> includes four desert species, with elongated, strong, curved, and pointed bills;
  long, stout legs; short, rounded wings; and moderate square tails. The colour is fawn, grey, and
  brown, generally with black and white wings and black tail; <i>P. hendersoni</i> and <i>P.
  biddulphi</i> have a black cap, the former shewing white spots on it, <i>P. panderi</i> has a
  black throat-patch, <i>P. humilis</i> is brown with whitish nape and lower parts. They haunt
  sand-hills covered with saxaul (<i>Anabasis ammodendron</i>) or tamarisk, from Transcaspia to
  Tibet, running swiftly, occasionally flying like a Jay, feeding on the ground upon insects, their
  larvae, and seeds, uttering harsh reiterated Woodpecker-like cries, and making a nest of twigs
  lined with bark, grass, and hair in low trees, bushes, or rarely holes in the ground. The four
  eggs are greenish-grey <span class="pagenum" id="page559"><span
  class="smaller">{559}</span></span>with olive spots. <i>P. humilis</i> frequents more grassy
  ground up to eleven thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXIV. <b>Sturnidae.</b>&ndash;The Starlings, apparently connecting the <i>Corvidae</i> and
  the <i>Icteridae</i>, are divided by Mr. Oates<a id="NtA_299" href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a>
  and Dr. Sharpe<a id="NtA_300" href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> into <i>Eulabetidae</i>
  (Tree-Starlings) with rictal bristles, more arboreal habits, and usually spotted eggs, and
  <i>Sturnidae</i> (Starlings proper) where the contrary holds good.<a id="NtA_301"
  href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> To these <i>Buphaga</i> may be added for the present, in
  default of a better position.</p>

  <p>The bill is generally long and pointed&ndash;especially in <i>Sturnopastor</i>,&ndash;but is
  exceptionally slender in <i>Cinnamopterus</i>, shorter and stouter in <i>Basilornis</i>,
  <i>Buphaga</i>, <i>Pastor</i>, <i>Pholidauges</i>, and <i>Aplonis</i>; being curved in the last
  three, and also in <i>Fregilupus</i> and <i>Necropsar</i>; where it is longer. The anteriorly
  scutellated metatarsus is ordinarily strong, and is shortest in the Tree-Starlings. The wing is
  usually moderate, with small first primary, though it is more elongated and pointed in
  <i>Sturnus</i> and <i>Dilophus</i>, rounded in <i>Sturnopastor</i>, <i>Temenuchus</i>, and so
  forth, short in <i>Coccycolius</i> and <i>Buphaga</i>; the secondaries have long filamentous basal
  appendages in <i>Psaroglossa</i>, and loose hair-like exterior webs in <i>Onychognathus</i>. The
  tail varies from short to long, from square to much graduated; it is forked in <i>Sturnia</i>, and
  may have acuminate feathers; while <i>Macruropsar</i> and <i>Lamprotornis</i> possess
  exceptionally developed rectrices, <i>L. caudatus</i> having the broad median pair longer than the
  body. Lanceolate feathers commonly adorn the neck and breast; bushy crests occur in <i>Pastor</i>
  and <i>Temenuchus</i>, smaller tufts in <i>Sturnia</i>, <i>Basilornis</i>, <i>Enodes</i>,
  <i>Fregilupus</i>, <i>Graculipica</i>, <i>Sturnornis</i> and <i>Acridotheres cristatellus</i>;
  recurved plumes may cover the nostrils, as in <i>Acridotheres</i>, <i>Ampeliceps</i>, and
  <i>Basilornis</i>; while bare chins, orbits, or ear-patches of brown, yellow, and the like are
  frequent. <i>Charitornis</i> has the throat and cheeks naked; <i>Dilophus</i> the head and throat
  bare, with two erect wattles above and one below; <i>Sarcops</i> dull-red naked orbits, and merely
  a narrow feathered line down the crown; <i>Eulabes</i> a yellow post-ocular lappet forking to the
  back of the eye and the eyebrow, and a yellow patch below; <i>Enodes</i> a broad, superciliary
  wax-like red line; and <i>Scissirostrum</i> similar crimson feathers on the rump.</p>

      (From <i>English Illustrated Magazine</i>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Most of the brighter species exhibit purple, coppery, blue and green reflexions, our familiar
  Starling (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>) being iridescent black, with buff marks above, and, after the
  autumn moult, white spots below. The female is duller, but in this Family the sexes usually differ
  little. <i>S. unicolor</i> is unspotted. <i>Spodiopsar burmanicus</i> has grey upper and pinkish
  under parts, with brownish wings and tail, white head, and white-tipped rectrices; <i>Sturnopastor
  contra</i> is blackish-brown and white above, and greyish beneath, with green-black head and
  throat and white cheeks; <i>Pastor roseus</i>, which wanders to Britain, is glossy black, with
  pink back and abdomen; <i>Graculipica melanoptera</i> is almost pure white, with black or bronzy
  remiges and rectrices. <i>Eulabes religiosa</i>, the Myna,&ndash;a name also popularly applied to
  <i>Acridotheres</i> (sacred to the god Ram Deo) and several other Indian forms,&ndash;is black,
  with purple and green reflexions, and a white patch on the wing-quills; <i>Cinnamopterus
  tenuirostris</i> is more highly coloured, with mainly chestnut primaries; <i>Melanopyrrhus
  orientalis</i> adds to its metallic black hue an orange head, neck, rump, and breast;
  <i>Lamprotornis</i> and the shorter-tailed <i>Lamprocolius</i> exhibit lovely greens, purples, and
  peacock-blues, relieved by golden-bronze; <i>Coccycolius</i> is golden-green with purple cheeks
  and abdomen. <i>Pholidauges leucogaster</i> is rich purplish-violet with white belly, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page561"><span class="smaller">{561}</span></span>the female being brown and
  buff above, and whitish below with dusky striations; <i>Calornis</i> and <i>Aplonis</i> are
  usually dullish green; while the extinct <i>Fregilupus varius</i> was ashy-brown, grey, and white.
  <i>Falculia</i> is white with blue-black back, wings, and tail. It frequents trees or streams, and
  utters plaintive, melodious notes. <i>Buphaga</i> is dull-brown, with fulvous rump and lower
  surface. The bill is commonly black throughout the group, but is sometimes red, pinkish, bluish,
  greenish, orange, or yellow; the feet also vary in colour. Albinos are rather frequent.</p>

  <p>This Family occupies almost all the Old World, but not America proper, though <i>Sturnus
  vulgaris</i> has strayed to Greenland; the headquarters lie in the Indian and Ethiopian Regions,
  wherein several forms have a very restricted distribution. Instances of this are
  <i>Charitornis</i> of the Sula Islands, <i>Scissirostrum</i>, <i>Enodes</i>, and
  <i>Streptocitta</i> of Celebes, <i>Hagiopsar</i> of the Dead Sea and Sinaitic districts,
  <i>Hartlaubius</i> and <i>Falculia</i> of Madagascar, <i>Sarcops</i> of the Philippines,
  <i>Mino</i> of Papuasia, <i>Melanopyrrhus</i> and <i>Macruropsar</i> of New Guinea and its
  islands, <i>Aplonis</i> of the Pacific and the Tenimber group. <i>Fregilupus</i>, of which only a
  few examples exist in collections, was confined to R&eacute;union, <i>Necropsar</i> is an extinct form
  from Rodriguez. <i>Calornis</i> alone inhabits Australia.</p>

  <p><i>Lamprotornis</i>, <i>Spodiopsar</i>, and the Eulabetidae in general, rarely leave the trees
  they haunt; on the other hand, some forms, as our Starling, spend much time upon the ground, or
  roost in huge flocks on shrubs, reeds, and the like. The habits are wary, and seldom as sociable
  as those of our British species, hills being often preferred to more wooded districts or the
  neighbourhood of houses. <i>Aethiopsar</i> reaches an altitude of seven thousand feet. The flight
  is strong, straight, and rapid, though heavier in <i>Buphaga</i>; while flocks of Starlings turn,
  sweep along, and gyrate in remarkable fashion, and soaring is not uncommon. The more terrestrial
  forms walk and run excellently, often stopping suddenly to probe the soil for worms or larvae,
  which, with insects generally, and molluscs, provide the chief sustenance. A large amount of fruit
  is also consumed, including berries and seeds; frogs and, as some say, callow nestlings are also
  devoured; <i>Pastor</i>, <i>Dilophus</i>, and <i>Acridotheres</i> destroy locusts; <i>Eulabes</i>
  and its allies prefer vegetable food; <i>Buphaga</i> is termed Ox-pecker or Rhinoceros-bird, from
  clearing ticks off those animals. Certain species disgorge nutriment for their young. The voice is
  commonly varied and pleasing, becoming <span class="pagenum" id="page562"><span
  class="smaller">{562}</span></span>a rich song in <i>Eulabes</i>; but most forms whistle, chatter,
  or utter harsh sounds; and many are extraordinary mimics, or even talk, like the Starling and the
  Myna, under tuition. By the more typical forms a rough nest of straw, twigs, rags, wool, or
  feathers is placed in holes in trees, walls, or banks; under eaves; in burrows or stone-heaps:
  from four to seven uniform light blue or whitish eggs being deposited. <i>Sturnopastor</i>, alone
  or in societies, affixes a huge structure to the outer branches of trees or bushes;
  <i>Dilophus</i> makes a neater cup in similar situations; <i>Calornis</i>, which usually forms
  colonies, suspends from the boughs a bulky bottle-shaped structure with a side-entrance, and so
  forth. Even our Starling at times builds an open nest. The Eulabetidae generally lay spotted eggs,
  <i>Dilophus</i> occasionally; <i>Calornis</i> has them greenish with reddish-brown marks.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXV. <b>Drepanididae.</b>&ndash;According to the latest views, namely those of Dr.
  Gadow,<a id="NtA_302" href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> this group contains only the curious
  forms below, which are all peculiar to the Sandwich Islands. In most of them the semi-tubular
  tongue is dorsally frayed out into a single brush, but in several thick-billed species it is but
  slightly tubular, and is split or frayed. The non-serrated beak varies greatly, being elongated
  and arched in <i>Vestiaria</i>; very long and curved with projecting maxilla in <i>Drepanis</i>
  and <i>Hemignathus</i>; and similar, but with the upcurved or straight mandible only about half as
  long as the maxilla in <i>Heterorhynchus</i>. In <i>Himatione</i>, <i>Oreomyza</i>, <i>Loxops</i>,
  <i>Palmeria</i>, <i>Ciridops</i>, and <i>Chrysomitridops</i> it is much shorter and little
  decurved; in <i>Psittacirostra</i>, <i>Loxio&iuml;des</i>, <i>Chloridops</i>, and <i>Rhodacanthis</i>
  it is stout, Finch-like, and hooked, being enormously developed in the last two; in the
  extraordinary <i>Pseudonestor</i> it is Parrot-like. In <i>Loxops</i> the mandible is twisted
  indifferently to either side, possibly by constant use. Over the nostrils an operculum is often
  present; but bristles of all kinds are absent. The scutes of the moderate metatarsus shew a
  tendency to fusion; the wings are of medium length, with a hardly visible outer primary. The tail
  is rather short and nearly square, having pointed rectrices in <i>Vestiaria</i> and
  <i>Drepanis</i>; and exhibits a tendency to forking. Fluffy feathering constantly characterizes
  the back, flanks, or axillary region. There is a more or less <span class="pagenum"
  id="page563"><span class="smaller">{563}</span></span>decided crop, as in many Finches. In some
  species the females appear to have shorter bills.</p>

      (After Wilson and Evans, <i>Aves Hawaiienses</i>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Drepanis pacifica</i> is black, with golden rump, upper and under tail-coverts, tibiae, and
  bend of wing, a little white shewing on the wings and tail; <i>D. funerea</i> is almost entirely
  black. <i>Vestiaria coccinea</i> is vermilion, with black remiges and rectrices, and some white on
  the wing-coverts; the bill and feet being red. <i>Hemignathus</i> and <i>Heterorhynchus</i> are
  greenish-olive above, with black lores, brownish remiges, and usually yellowish or creamy lower
  surface; but the head is occasionally yellow. <i>Palmeria dolii</i> has blackish plumage with
  scarlet or orange tips, a brilliant scarlet-orange nape, an orange space round the eye, similarly
  coloured tibiae, a grey throat, and a dirty white crest curving over the culmen. <i>Himatione</i>
  is generally yellow-green, with browner wings, yellow under parts, and sometimes black lores; the
  very closely allied <i>Oreomyza</i> may be duller or greyer, with buff and white below. <i>H.
  sanguinea</i> is crimson, with black and red wings, and black tail. <i>Loxops</i>, which in one
  species is dimorphic, is scarlet or orange, with brown on the remiges and rectrices;
  <i>Chrysomitridops</i> is yellowish-olive, with yellow crown and lower surface, black on the wings
  and tail, and bluish bill. <i>Psittacirostra</i> is greenish with yellow head; <i>Rhodacanthis</i>
  is reddish-orange with browner back, or in one case yellow head, while the female is green.
  <i>Ciridops</i> is red, with black throat, tail, and most of the wings, grey nape and cheeks; it
  approaches <i>Cyanospiza ciris</i> (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page585">585</a></span>) in
  colour.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page564"><span class="smaller">{564}</span></span></div>

  <p>Hens are ordinarily duller (often brownish or green), except in <i>Vestiaria</i> and
  <i>Himatione sanguinea</i>; the young are greenish-yellow relieved by black in <i>Vestiaria</i>,
  brown and buff in <i>Palmeria</i> and <i>Himatione sanguinea</i>, and assume the red or orange
  gradually.</p>

  <p>These forms now chiefly haunt high damp hill-forests, though <i>Vestiaria</i> still occurs near
  the coast; they fly comparatively little, but spend much of their time creeping quietly and
  rapidly over the trunks and branches of acacia, "ohia," "mamane," and other trees, where they hunt
  for insects below the bark or on the leaves. None habitually seek the ground. The long-billed
  species delight in probing the decayed wood, and insert their mandibles into the crevices in
  search of food, which consists partly of lepidopterous larvae and spiders. Fruit is largely eaten,
  pods being split to obtain seeds, and honey is sucked either for its own sake or for the insects
  it attracts. The stomach at times contains grit. Most forms have a sweet song, the call-note being
  a reiterated "tweet" or metallic chirp; <i>Rhodacanthis</i>, moreover, whistles. <i>Himatione
  virens</i> makes a nest of roots and decayed leaves in trees, <i>Loxops aurea</i> apparently does
  the same; the former lays whitish eggs freckled and streaked with purplish-brown, but little is
  known of the reproduction. The splendid feather-cloaks of the Hawaiian kings, the "leis"
  (wreaths), waist-bands, and mask-decorations, were of old chiefly composed of the plumage of the
  "Mamo" (<i>Drepanis pacifica</i>), and the Iiwi (<i>Vestiaria coccinea</i>); but when the former
  became scarce, the lighter yellow tufts (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page565">565</a></span>)
  of the O-o (<i>Acrulocercus</i>) were utilized to pay the feather tax, though the cloaks were
  still called "Mamo." <i>Himatione sanguinea</i> was also laid under contribution, as was in later
  times the domestic cock.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXVI. <b>Meliphagidae.</b>&ndash;The Honey-eaters, seldom bigger than a Thrush, are
  remarkable for their extensile quadruple or multiple tongue, which is frayed out latero-dorsally.
  They occupy the Australian Region, from which <i>Ptilotis limbata</i> alone crosses Wallace's line
  (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page16">16</a></span>) to Bali, and often have very restricted
  ranges. Two Sub-families may be recognised, <i>Myzomelinae</i> and <i>Meliphaginae</i>. The thin
  curved bill is commonly long, with prominent culmen and wide base; <i>Melithreptes</i> and
  <i>Plectrorhynchus</i>, however, have it short, and the latter straight. The maxilla is nearly
  always notched and serrated, several species of <i>Philemon</i> exhibiting a basal protuberance.
  The metatarsi may be long, as in <i>Acrulocercus</i>, or abbreviated as in <i>Manorhina</i>, the
  short anterior toes being partially <span class="pagenum" id="page565"><span
  class="smaller">{565}</span></span>connected; the wings are variable in length,
  <i>Melithreptes</i> possessing comparatively small secondaries, <i>Anthornis</i> an abruptly
  narrowed second primary. The tail also varies in size; it is much rounded in <i>Melidectes</i> and
  <i>Meliphaga</i>, square in <i>Acanthorhynchus</i>, emarginated in <i>Anthornis</i>, and
  particularly long and graduated with pointed rectrices in <i>Acrulocercus</i> and
  <i>Chaetoptila</i>&ndash;<i>A. nobilis</i> having the median pair produced and spirally twisted,
  <i>A. apicalis</i> the ends upturned. <i>Pogonornis</i> has strong rictal bristles.</p>

  <p>The <i>Myzomelinae</i> are usually habited in scarlet and black, as in the Soldier-bird of
  Australia (<i>Myzomela sanguinolenta</i>), with or without white or yellowish below; some,
  however, are chiefly or entirely olive or greyish-brown, while the females generally differ from
  the males, and the former occasionally shew red when the latter do not. A second genus,
  <i>Acanthorhynchus</i>, or Cobbler's Awl, is brown, chestnut, buff, black, and white. In the
  <i>Meliphaginae</i> the sexes are commonly alike, and exhibit a mixture of brown, olive, yellow,
  black, white, grey, rufous, and buff; the under parts frequently, and the upper rarely, being
  streaked or spotted. Metallic hues are rare, but <i>Anthornis</i> has a purplish gloss on the
  head. <i>Leptornis</i>, <i>Entomyza</i>, <i>Philemon</i>, <i>Melitograis</i>, and
  <i>Pycnopygius</i> are instances of dusky or olive coloration with lighter lower surface;
  <i>Prosthemadera</i> and <i>Certhionyx leucomelas</i> are black and white; <i>Plectrorhynchus</i>
  is brown and white; <i>Meliphaga</i> is yellow and black, spotted and barred below. The Hawaiian
  <i>Acrulocercus</i> is black or brownish, with a little white on the wings or tail, and possesses
  yellow axillary tufts and under tail-coverts, save in <i>A. braccatus</i>, where the tufts are
  grey-buff, the tibiae are yellow, the throat is barred with white, and the lower parts are
  streaky. <i>A. bishopi</i> has yellow ear-tufts. Their close ally, <i>Chaetoptila</i>, of the same
  islands, is light brown and yellowish above, with white spots, and a black cheek-stripe; the under
  surface being white with brown streaks, and the rump and flanks ochreous. The neck- and
  breast-plumage is lanceolate and decomposed. Many species of <i>Ptilotis</i> have white or yellow
  ear-tufts; the male of <i>Pogonornis</i> possesses white erectile post-ocular feathers; that of
  <i>Prosthemadera</i> two gular patches of curled white filamentary plumes, which give it the name
  of Parson-bird, as well as pointed white feathers curving forward from the sides of the neck. In
  two members of <i>Meliornis</i> white fan-like shields spring from the cheeks; <i>Glycyphila
  albifrons</i> has a white circum-ocular ring; while many forms have peculiar <span class="pagenum"
  id="page566"><span class="smaller">{566}</span></span>cheek-feathers, fluffy chests, rumps or
  sides, and lanceolate or bristly plumage on the neck, cheeks, or throat. Naked blue, green,
  scarlet, yellow, lilac, pink, or whitish areas on the head, and pendant rictal or facial wattles,
  are frequent, especially in <i>Meliphaga</i>, <i>Ptilotis</i>, <i>Entomyza</i>, <i>Philemon</i>,

  vary from black to red, yellow, blue, or green.</p>

  <p>The habits are fairly uniform, though certain species are comparatively shy. Small flocks often
  gather together, the haunts being dense forests, or open wooded country whether inland or
  littoral; some forms prefer the tree-tops, others low bushes and shrubs. These active, pugnacious
  birds dart about in zigzag fashion, or take powerful undulating flights, the tail meanwhile being
  frequently thrown back or expanded; at times they hover, or fall from aloft with closed wings.</p>

  <p>Constantly seen hopping among the boughs, or climbing and hanging to the twigs, in search of
  the insects which constitute so much of their diet, they occasionally feed upon the
  ground&ndash;especially in the case of <i>Ptilotis</i>; while <i>Meliornis</i> and
  <i>Entomophila</i> will dart after their prey like Flycatchers. Figs and bananas, with other
  fruits and buds, are also eaten; honey is sucked from the flowers of <i>Eucalyptus</i>,
  <i>Acacia</i>, <i>Epacris</i>, and the like, in considerable quantities, the insects it attracts
  being perhaps the chief object; and <i>Philemon</i> batters large insects upon the branches before
  swallowing them. The voice is commonly loud, rich, and shrill, but varies from a whistle or a pipe
  to a chirp; some species, however, are more quiet, others give vent to slow, plaintive cries,
  quickly reiterated notes, or comparatively harsh sounds. The Tui, or Parson-bird, utters a wild
  song, laughs, coughs, sneezes, and mimics generally; <i>Acrulocercus</i> gets the name of O-o from
  its harsh double call; <i>Pogonornis</i> that of Stitch-bird from its clicking cry, though it also
  whistles; while <i>Philemon corniculatus</i> is sometimes called "Four-o'clock," "Poor Soldier,"
  or Pimlico, from its note. <i>Anthornis</i>, the New Zealand "Bell-bird," usually heard in chorus,
  has a voice like the tinkling of a silver bell.<a id="NtA_303" href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a>
  The nest, normally a slight structure of twigs, roots, bark, grass, and spiders' webs, lined with
  woolly materials, fur, or feathers, is placed in bushes, trees, or even tall grass, and generally
  has the rim woven over a supporting fork. A few species, however, including the New Zealand forms,
  <i>Pogonornis</i>, <i>Anthornis</i>, and <i>Prosthemadera</i>, build a solid fabric of twigs and
  rough materials <span class="pagenum" id="page568"><span class="smaller">{568}</span></span>among
  the branches. The eggs, two, three, or rarely four in number, are buffish-white, salmon-coloured
  or, exceptionally, olive, with spots, freckles, zones, and occasionally lines, of red-brown,
  rufous, bright red, blackish and grey. Two or three broods are reared annually. <i>Entomyza
  cyanotis</i>, the Blue-eye, re-lines deserted birds' nests, or utilizes the top of that of
  <i>Pomatostomus</i>; <i>Glycyphila modesta</i> and <i>G. fasciata</i> make hanging domed fabrics.
  The mimicry between <i>Philemon</i>&ndash;called Friar-bird, Monk, or Leather-head, from the bare
  head and ruff of some species&ndash;and <i>Mimeta</i> has been already noticed (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page543">543</a></span>). Cloaks are fashioned from the Stitch-bird's
  feathers, as well as from those of the O-os (<span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page564">564</a></span>).<a id="NtA_304" href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fam. XXVII. <b>Zosteropidae.</b>&ndash;The "White-eyes," so denominated from the white ring
  usually surrounding the eye, form a single genus, <i>Zosterops</i>, of doubtful position. They
  range through parts of the Ethiopian Region, with Madagascar and the Comoros, and occupy most of
  the Indian and Australian Regions, whence they reach to Amur-land and Japan. The straight or
  slightly curved bill has the maxilla serrated and nearly always notched; the metatarsus is of
  medium length; the outer and middle toes are partially united; the wings are rather short with
  little or no exterior primary; the tail is moderate, broad and square, or even emarginated. Dr.
  Gadow<a id="NtA_305" href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> pronounces the protractile tongue to be
  forked and smooth in <i>Z. lateralis</i>; Mr. Beddard<a id="NtA_306"
  href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> finds the margins folded, and the tip frayed out in <i>Z.
  simplex</i> and <i>Z. japonica</i>. The sexes are alike, the coloration being principally olive
  and yellow, relieved by brown, grey, fawn, or white. The habits are similar to those of the
  Meliphagidae; the eggs, however, are pale blue. <i>Z. caerulescens</i>, the New Zealand
  "Blight-bird," destroys the "American Blight" (<i>Schizoneura lanigera</i>), a scale-insect.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXVIII. <b>Nectariniidae.</b>&ndash;The Old World Sun-birds, recalling the non-Passerine
  Humming-birds by their brilliant metallic coloration, are actually given the latter name in India,
  whence they extend through Southern Asia to Papuasia and North Australia. They also occupy the
  whole Ethiopian Region, while <i>Cinnyris osea</i> inhabits Palestine, <i>C. brevirostris</i>
  Baluchistan and South Persia, and an undetermined species the Muskat district in Arabia.
  <i>Promerops</i> is a doubtful member of the Family.<a id="NtA_307"

  <p>The long slender bill, without bristles of any kind, is much produced and curved in
  <i>Neodrepanis</i>; both mandibles being terminally serrated, except in <i>Promerops</i> and
  <i>Chalcoparia</i>, of which the former has the maxilla notched. The extensible tongue is bifid,
  with each half frayed out medio-ventrally, save in <i>Promerops</i>, where it is a semi-canal with
  dorso-laterally frayed edges. The metatarsi are moderate, the claws curved and acute.
  <i>Arachnothera</i> has both the bill and the feet stouter. The more or less rounded wings are of
  medium length; the tail varies from square or nearly so to graduated, and has two narrow elongated
  median rectrices in the males of <i>Hedydipna</i>, <i>Nectarinia</i>, <i>Anthobaphes</i>,
  <i>Aethopyga</i>, <i>Urodrepanis</i> and <i>Drepanorhynchus</i>. That of <i>Promerops</i> is
  extraordinarily long and graduated in both sexes. <i>Arachnothera chrysogenys</i> has the loral
  region naked, and the male of <i>Neodrepanis</i> bluish circum-ocular wattles.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to describe shortly the diverse coloration of the various species; some shew
  much green, black, brown, or olive; nearly all exhibit brilliant, if not metallic, red, blue,
  lilac, copper, yellow, or orange tints; a few are chiefly purple; many are longitudinally streaked
  below; in others the breast is white, or exhibits red or orange bands, while the fore-neck may be
  vermilion striped with lilac. The sides of the back frequently possess long downy feathers, and
  pectoral tufts are common. In <i>Arachnothera</i> both sexes are greyish or greenish, relieved by
  a little yellow or orange. Females, however, are usually sombre, the young being similar. The bill
  is black or brown, the feet vary in hue.</p>

  <p>These small graceful forms, restless, though not shy, are rarely seen in companies, but usually
  in pairs; they frequent groves and forests up to an altitude of about a thousand feet, resorting
  to more open country and gardens when the shrubs are flowering. The food consists mainly of
  insects&ndash;sometimes taken on the <span class="pagenum" id="page570"><span
  class="smaller">{570}</span></span>wing&ndash;with their larvae and spiders; while the birds hop
  actively about, and cling to the branches and trunks of trees, like Tits or Creepers, or even to
  bushes and grass. They rarely hover before flowers as Humming-birds do, though frequently sucking
  honey. When feeding or singing the wings are often opened and shut alternately. The quick, direct
  flight is accompanied by rapid pulsations of the pinions, and the males chase their rivals
  angrily. The shrill, but pleasing and varied notes recall those of the Willow-Warbler. The
  pear-shaped or oval nests, woven or attached by cobwebs to the ends of boughs, to the under
  surfaces of leaves, or more rarely to reed-stems, are composed of grass, moss, roots, and the
  like, lined with hair, feathers, and down, and usually have a projecting porch. Beneath are
  attached as decorations leaves, twigs, lichens, shreds of bark, paper, and cloth, wood-borings, or
  caterpillars' excreta. <i>Arachnothera magna</i>, at least occasionally, builds an open nest. The
  two or three eggs are commonly greenish- or brownish-grey, with purplish, reddish-brown,
  yellowish, or dusky dots and spots; some, however, are whiter, with blackish markings, dark zones,
  or hair-streaks; while those of <i>Arachnothera magna</i> are brownish, very thickly speckled with
  purplish-black. <i>Promerops cafer</i> makes a cup of grass, fibres, and softer materials in forks
  of bushes, and lays creamy eggs like those of Buntings, with wavy lines or irregular blotches of
  dark brown or purplish.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXIX. <b>Dicaeidae.</b>&ndash;The "Flower-peckers" inhabit the Indian and Australian
  Regions as far eastwards as the Low Archipelago, a few possibly kindred species occupying West
  Africa. The bill is usually short, broad, and depressed, but is especially slender in
  <i>Pholidornis</i>, stout and Finch-like in <i>Prionochilus</i>; while both mandibles shew minute
  terminal serrations. Feathers cover the nostrils in <i>Pardalotus</i>, and in life <i>Lobornis</i>
  has three small white rictal outgrowths. The tongue is separated into four semi-tubular fringeless
  projections. The metatarsus is never long; the wings are fairly so; the tail is generally short
  and even, but is rounded in <i>Prionochilus vincens</i>, longer in most Papuasian forms, and
  sometimes graduated, as in <i>Pristorhamphus</i>. Many species exhibit vivid combinations of blue
  or purple with black, relieved by a scarlet or an orange head, rump, or chest-patch, the lower
  surface being yellow, greyish, or greenish-white; some, however, replace the blue shades by green,
  brown, or olive; others are quite plain; and <i>Melanocharis unicolor</i> is perfectly black. The
  <span class="pagenum" id="page571"><span class="smaller">{571}</span></span>Diamond-bird
  (<i>Pardalotus</i>) has scattered white dots above, and scarlet or yellow tips to the primary
  coverts; <i>Dicaeum</i> often shews a longitudinal black band below; while bars and streaks occur
  not infrequently. The bill is blackish, or in <i>Dicaeum erythrorhynchum</i> reddish. The female
  is almost invariably duller.</p>

  <p>These small birds frequent woods and gardens, the little flocks often haunting lofty trees near
  rivers; they hop briskly among the boughs, dart from bush to bush, creep about and cling like
  Tits, and utter a long, low warble, or in <i>Pardalotus</i> a harsh monotonous piping note. The
  food consists of insects, varied by spiders, fruit, buds, seeds, and perhaps honey. <i>Dicaeum</i>
  and <i>Prionochilus</i> suspend from some twig a domed, pear-shaped nest of white cottony
  material, frequently covered with grass or moss, and decorated with caterpillars' excreta;
  <i>Pardalotus</i> chooses old Swallows' nurseries, or holes in trees and walls, or even tunnels a
  short way into banks, making within a spherical fabric of roots, grass, bark, and feathers. The
  two to five eggs are commonly white, but in <i>Prionochilus</i> (<i>Piprisoma</i>)
  <i>squalidus</i> they are redder, with dense brown-pink or claret-coloured blotches or specks.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXX. <b>Certhiidae.</b>&ndash;The Creepers, a small, though widespread group, occupy most
  of the Palaearctic and Nearctic Regions; Africa from Benguela to Mashona-Land; Australia and New
  Guinea. The bill is long and generally decurved, but shorter and straighter in <i>Climacteris</i>;
  while nasal and rictal bristles are absent. The metatarsi are of medium length and slender, though
  stouter in <i>Salpornis</i>; <i>Tichodroma</i> and <i>Climacteris</i> have the scutes fused; and
  the toes&ndash;especially the hallux&ndash;have long, curved claws. The wings vary from moderate
  and rounded to elongated and pointed; the tail is usually short and square, or very nearly so, but
  has stiff, graduated, acuminate feathers in <i>Certhia</i>. The coloration of both sexes is brown,
  black, rufous, buff, grey, and white, except in <i>Tichodroma</i>, which exhibits crimson
  wing-patches on its grey, black, and white plumage. Bars and spots are frequent, particularly
  beneath.</p>

  <p>The majority are tame birds, inhabiting thinly wooded districts, often close to dwellings; but
  the European and Asiatic <i>Tichodroma muraria</i>, which has strayed to Britain, haunts mountain
  cliffs, and, when on migration, walls also. They utter shrill cries, or, more commonly, low
  reiterated notes, which in our Creeper (<i>Certhia familiaris</i>) are varied by a sweet and
  fairly loud song; <span class="pagenum" id="page572"><span class="smaller">{572}</span></span>the
  food consists of insects and their larvae, ants, and spiders. Beginning at the bottom of a trunk
  the birds work actively but jerkily upwards in zigzags or spirals, flitting from the higher
  branches to the base of another tree; sometimes, however, they take protracted, undulating
  flights, or accompany flocks of Tits in winter. <i>Certhia</i> uses the rigid rectrices as
  Woodpeckers do (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page457">457</a></span>), though the soft-tailed
  forms also climb well, while <i>Climacteris</i> is exceptional in spending much time hopping or
  shuffling along the ground. Seeds of conifers occasionally vary the diet. The nest, composed of
  twigs, with the addition of grass or moss, and lined with bast, hair, wool, or feathers, is placed
  behind loose bark, under tiles, in crevices of trees or walls, in piles of bricks, hollow
  branches, or even the base of large birds' habitations. The three to nine eggs are ordinarily
  white with red and lilac spots; but in <i>Climacteris</i> the ground-colour is sometimes reddish,
  in <i>Salpornis</i> the spots are blackish. The last-named fixes a cup-shaped fabric of leaves,
  bark, and cobwebs to some horizontal bough.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXXI. <b>Coerebidae.</b>&ndash;The Quit-quits have the extensible tongue bifid, and frayed
  out terminally. The bill may be conical, but is usually slender, with a notch and sometimes with
  rictal bristles, while the long maxilla is hooked in <i>Diglossa</i> and <i>Diglossopis</i>; the
  metatarsi, wings, and tail are moderate, the last being sometimes forked. These small, active, and
  restless birds frequent bushy places and the outskirts of forests, from South Florida to the
  Bolivian Andes and South-East Brazil, several species being peculiar to the Antilles, and
  <i>Certhidea</i> to the Gal&aacute;pagos. Though companies are seldom formed, the flight and habits are
  Tit-like, and individuals are often seen hopping about or clinging to the branches in search of
  the insects which, with fruit, form the usual food. They probe the flowers in company with
  Humming-birds, and probably suck the honey, while some forms dart after flies like Flycatchers.
  Several have a fine voice, but the common note is a feeble "quit-quit." The domed <span
  class="pagenum" id="page573"><span class="smaller">{573}</span></span>nest, made of grass, moss,
  roots, and fibres, occasionally has a projecting porch, and is frequently lined with down or
  feathers; the two to four eggs being white or greenish-blue, with dull-red or yellowish-brown
  blotches or specks. In the Antilles <i>Certhiola</i> weaves a domed structure of similar
  materials, hair, and spiders' webs, between the outermost twigs of bushes. Many nests are built
  without being used.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The coloration varies from black, grey, or purplish, relieved by rufous and white, to brilliant
  blue, purple, or green, with the quills only black, or with further yellow, chestnut, and
  exceptionally scarlet, decorations. Uniform black, or olive and brown hues are unusual, save in
  females, which, however, are often bright green, with the addition of a little blue or yellow.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXXII. <b>Mniotiltidae.</b>&ndash;The "American Warblers," almost replacing the
  <i>Sylviinae</i> in the New World, are a somewhat heterogeneous assemblage of rather small birds,
  of which <i>Granatellus</i> is perhaps Tanagrine. They frequent localities of all descriptions in
  North and South America, being commonest in the middle portions. <i>Teretistris</i> is peculiar to
  Cuba, <i>Leucopeza</i> to St. Lucia and St. Vincent; <i>Ergaticus</i> occupies the Central
  American highlands, while two or three species wander to Greenland.</p>

  <p>The bill is usually slender and straight, but varies in length and curvature, that of
  <i>Setophaga</i> and <i>Myiodioctes</i> being broad and depressed with bristly gape, that of
  <i>Icteria</i> (doubtfully referred here) very stout and compressed, and so forth. Other species
  also exhibit bristles, or have notched beaks. The tongue is frequently bifid and fringed in
  <i>Dendroeca</i>, and in <i>D.</i> (<i>Perissoglossa</i>) <i>tigrina</i> is semitubular. The
  metatarsi are naturally longest and strongest in the more terrestrial forms, such as
  <i>Geothlypis</i> and <i>Siurus</i>; <i>Icteria</i> has partly feathered legs, <i>Mniotilta</i>
  particularly long toes. The wings may be concave and roundish, as in <i>Leucopeza</i> and
  <i>Geothlypis</i>, or elongated and pointed, as in <i>Protonotaria</i> and <i>Peucedramus</i>; the
  moderate tail is square, rounded, or emarginate, or, as in <i>Setophaga</i>, broad and graduated.
  The general coloration is <span class="pagenum" id="page574"><span
  class="smaller">{574}</span></span>olive-green, grey, or slaty-blue, with yellow or rarely orange
  under parts; chestnut marks, white wing-bands, and the like, occasionally relieving the plumage.
  The head is often particularly dark or streaky. <i>Mniotilta</i> exhibits black and white stripes;
  <i>Ergaticus</i> shews chiefly crimson and white; <i>Granatellus</i> is grey, black, and white
  above, but red and white with black collar below. <i>Setophaga</i>, the "American Redstart," is
  mainly red and black, or red and plumbeous; <i>Cardellina</i> is grey, black, and white with
  crimson cheeks and throat; <i>Siurus</i> has olive-brown upper, and whitish under parts, with
  dusky striations. The bill is black or brown, commonly with pinkish, yellowish, or bluish
  mandible.</p>

  </div>

  <p>These active, restless, and often shy birds either seek their food, consisting chiefly of
  insects and their larvae, worms, spiders, and even molluscs, upon the ground or upon the bark of
  trees. Many forms resemble Tits in their actions; <i>Mniotilta</i> and others ascend the trunks
  spirally like Creepers; <i>Setophaga</i> and its allies&ndash;and exceptionally
  <i>Dendroeca</i>&ndash;sally after insects like Flycatchers; <i>D. palmarum</i> and <i>Siurus</i>
  run along with the tail in motion, the former recalling a Titlark, the latter gaining, from its
  appearance and habit of wading, the name of Water-Thrush. The flight is usually swift, easy, and
  graceful, yet brief and frequently undulating; <i>Myiodioctes</i> and <i>Setophaga</i> flit about
  alternately opening and closing the rectrices. Fruits, including conifer- and grass-seeds, vary
  the diet. Small parties collect in winter. A few species, such as <i>Basileuterus</i>,
  <i>Setophaga</i>, <i>Myiodioctes</i>, and <i>Siurus</i> have fine clear songs, but the usual
  utterances are feeble warbles, sweet whistles, reiterated "chirrups," or mournful trills. The
  majority build their cup-shaped nests in trees, bushes, and thickets generally, <i>Dendroeca</i>
  in some districts choosing a fir; they are <span class="pagenum" id="page575"><span
  class="smaller">{575}</span></span>made of grass, bark, leaves, roots, moss, hair, fur, lichens,
  and spiders' webs, or even twigs, sedges, and feathers, and contain from two to six creamy or,
  exceptionally, greenish or purplish eggs, more or less spotted or blotched with red-brown, grey,
  and lilac, or sometimes, as in <i>Myiodioctes</i>, scrawled with black.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXXIII. <b>Tanagridae.</b><a id="NtA_308" href="#Nt_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a>&ndash;The
  Tanagers form a New World group, hardly distinguishable from the <i>Fringillidae</i>, except by
  their more feeble conformation and their exposed nostrils. The coloration is often particularly
  gorgeous, but their habits are comparatively little known. The bill varies much in length and
  thickness, the hooked tip being highly developed in <i>Lamprotes</i> and <i>Sericossypha</i>,
  while <i>Procnias</i> has a wide Swallow-like gape. The metatarsi are short and stout; the toes
  are large, with sharp curved claws in <i>Lamprotes</i> and <i>Sericossypha</i>; the wings are
  moderate and somewhat pointed, being unusually long in <i>Procnias</i>; while the tail may be very
  short as in <i>Euphonia</i>, but is rarely long and graduated as in <i>Cissopis</i>, and only
  occasionally forked.</p>

  <p>These birds are characteristic of the forests and wooded country of the Neotropical Region,
  whence four species of <i>Pyranga</i> extend to the United States, and two reach Canada and
  British Columbia respectively; several forms, moreover, are peculiar to the Antilles. They are
  chiefly of small size, <i>Euphonia</i> possessing the least and <i>Pitylus</i> or <i>Saltator</i>
  the largest members of the Family; the sexes are commonly similar, but the female is often duller,
  or even quite different from the male, as in <i>Rhamphocoelus</i> and <i>Pyranga</i>. A short
  crest occurs rarely, as in <i>Eucometis</i> and <i>Stephanophorus</i>. The prevailing colours are
  black and red or uniform red in <i>Pyranga</i>, <i>Phlogothraupis</i>, and most species of
  <i>Rhamphocoelus</i> and <i>Calochaetes</i>; blue or purplish-black and yellow in
  <i>Buthraupis</i>, <i>Iridornis</i>, and their nearest allies; blue and black in <i>Procnias</i>
  and <i>Pseudodacnis</i>; orange or yellow, with black and white in <i>Spindalis</i> and
  <i>Lanio</i>; black and white in <i>Lamprospiza</i> and <i>Cissopis</i>; olive and brown in
  <i>Chlorospingus</i>; chestnut and brown in <i>Orchesticus</i>; grey, olive, yellow, or green,
  with more or less blue in <i>Thraupis</i> (<i>Tanagra</i>). <i>Buarremon</i> and several other
  forms are comparatively dull; <i>Tanagra</i> (<i>Calliste</i>) exhibits a beautiful mixture of all
  the above hues; <i>Euphonia</i> is also varied, but lacks scarlet tints; <i>Chlorochrysa</i> is
  brilliant green, relieved by orange, chestnut, blue, and black. The bill may be red, black,
  yellow, <span class="pagenum" id="page576"><span class="smaller">{576}</span></span>leaden or
  horn-coloured. Roughly speaking, <i>Tanagra</i> contains sixty species, <i>Euphonia</i>,
  <i>Chlorospingus</i>, and <i>Buarremon</i> each over thirty.</p>

  <p>The flight of these bold, lively, and restless birds&ndash;often met with in small
  parties&ndash;is Finch-like and not uncommonly brief; the song, frequently heard in chorus, is
  mellow and pleasing, accompanied by chattering, whistling, and chirping notes; the diet consists
  of insects and fruits, even the latter being occasionally snatched upon the wing; while worms,
  larvae, and molluscs are eaten, and some species scratch for food among fallen leaves. The nests
  are usually shallow fabrics of grass, roots, fibres, moss, and lichens, lined with hair or down;
  twigs, broad leaves, or fern-stems being commonly added below: they are sometimes placed in forks
  of trees or bushes, if not at the ends of branches; sometimes in masses of creepers, or even upon
  the ground; that of <i>Pyrrhuphonia</i> is domed, while that of <i>Rhamphocoelus brasilius</i> is
  built in tall grass in marshy places. The two to four eggs are white, bluish, greenish, grey,
  salmon-coloured, or rich brown, being at times uniform, but generally blotched, spotted, freckled,
  lined, or scrolled with brown, lilac, red, purple, or black. <i>Procnias</i> is said to lay three
  or four white eggs in holes in trees or in the soil, upon a bed of roots and plant-stems.<a

  developed, may be divided<a id="NtA_310" href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> into the Sub-families
  <i>Viduinae</i>, occurring in the Ethiopian, Indian, and Australian Regions, in which this quill
  is small <span class="pagenum" id="page577"><span class="smaller">{577}</span></span>and falcate,
  and <i>Ploceinae</i>, peculiar to Africa and its islands&ndash;with the exception of the genera
  <i>Ploceus</i> and <i>Ploce&euml;lla</i> of the Indian Region&ndash;in which it is larger. The former
  group includes the long-tailed Widow-birds, the red-beaked Wax-bills, and so forth; the latter the
  more typical Weaver-birds; Africa furnishing by far the greatest number of species. The bill is
  normally strong and conical, but is unusually long and slender in <i>Emblema</i>, and particularly
  stout with ridged culmen in <i>Amblyospiza</i>; the maxilla may be toothed, as in
  <i>Pyrenestes</i>, or festooned, as in <i>Spermestes</i>. The metatarsus is moderate, and the hind
  claw sometimes lengthened, as in <i>Icteropsis</i>. The rounded or pointed wings have very long
  secondaries, and the tail shews a slight fork; while in the breeding season the four median
  rectrices in the males of <i>Vidua</i> and several allied genera are extraordinarily elongated,
  being then either broad or tapering, and reduced to threads at the extremity, or bare-shafted with
  racquet tips.<a id="NtA_311" href="#Nt_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> Crests are uncommon, hair-like
  plumes on the nape more frequent, while <i>Pyromelaena</i> and <i>Urobrachya</i> have a neck-frill
  in summer.</p>

  <p>The coloration of these rather small birds is most striking, though the females are usually
  much duller than the males, which have in some cases a sober winter garb. <i>Vidua principalis</i>
  is black and white; <i>Penthetria ardens</i> is black with scarlet gorget; <i>Philetaerus
  socius</i> is brown, buff, black, and white; <i>Zonaeginthus bellus</i> is brown above, with
  transverse black lines and crimson rump, but silver grey below with black bars; <i>Hypochera
  ultramarina</i> is entirely purplish-blue; <i>Sporaeginthus amandava</i>, the Amadavat, is chiefly
  crimson with white dots; <i>Munia oryzivora</i>, the "Java Sparrow," is blue-grey and black with
  white cheeks. <i>M. punctulata</i>, the Cowry- or Nutmeg-bird, is brown, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page578"><span class="smaller">{578}</span></span>with white streaks above and spots below, a
  yellow rump, and a white middle to the under parts. <i>Po&euml;phila mirabilis</i>, one of the
  Grass-finches, shews a beautiful combination of pale green, blue, lilac, scarlet, yellow, black,
  brown, and white; <i>Neochmia pha&euml;ton</i> is crimson, brown, and black; <i>Foudia</i> is generally
  crimson and black; <i>Hyphantornis cucullatus</i> is golden-yellow, black, and chestnut;
  <i>Ploceus baya</i> is yellow and brown; <i>Textor albirostris</i> is entirely black. The bill is
  not uncommonly coral-red, as in <i>Estrelda</i> and other "Wax-bills;" but it varies from red to
  horn-coloured in <i>Vidua</i>, and may be whitish, as in <i>Textor albirostris</i>, as well as
  black, grey, rose-tinted, brownish, orange, or nearly blue. The feet may also be red, brown,
  purplish, dusky, or flesh-coloured.</p>

  <p>Weaver-birds are generally tame, and often approach habitations; the larger species frequenting
  woods and gardens, open country, sugar-cane fields, or reed-beds, but many of the smaller
  preferring grassy flats, bushy places, or even stony hills. They are usually social, and
  frequently pugnacious. The flight, though somewhat brief and heavy, is fairly rapid; <i>Chera</i>
  and <i>Vidua</i> rise with arched tail, and hover with flapping wings, at times soaring almost out
  of sight to descend again with great velocity. <i>Sycobrotus</i> climbs especially well,
  <i>Donacicola</i> hangs to the reeds like a Bunting, and indeed it is doubtful whether the
  Australian forms are not really generalized Finches. The usual utterance is a harsh churr, a
  shrill piping cry, a chattering or a twittering noise, often preceded by a single mournful note;
  but some species sing fairly well in chorus. The food, generally procured upon the ground,
  consists mainly of seeds, but is varied by insects&ndash;occasionally taken on the
  wing,&ndash;fruits, and flowers; while the birds play havoc with rice and other crops, often
  clinging to the stems until they have eaten every grain from the head.</p>

  <p>The nest is almost invariably a large mass of roughish grass or flags, bristling with the
  thicker ends of the stalks; it is usually lined with finer stems, but sometimes with feathers,
  down, and wool, while sticks, twigs, roots, and the like may be added exteriorly. The fabric is
  normally "retort-shaped," that is to say, globular with a "spout" or tubular passage, which curves
  downwards either from the middle or from the top of one side; but some of the structures resemble
  flasks placed horizontally; others have little or no spout, or hang by a sort of rope; and
  occasionally the materials do not quite meet above. Weaver-birds, especially the more typical
  <span class="pagenum" id="page579"><span class="smaller">{579}</span></span>species, commonly
  build in colonies, the most remarkable instance being that of <i>Philetaerus</i>, where an
  umbrella-shaped mass of sticks and straw is formed among the branches of a tree, and in its flat
  under surface holes for as many as three hundred nests are excavated. <i>Textor</i> makes a
  somewhat similar joint fabric. In certain cases the hen is said to sit in the roughly-fashioned
  shell, and to receive the thin ends of the straws from her mate, as he, clinging to the outside,
  pushes them through with his beak; she then passes them through to him again, and so the process
  is repeated in true webster fashion. An inner partition is often made to prevent the eggs from
  rolling out. The structures are placed in trees or bushes, frequently overhanging water, in
  sugar-canes, reeds, foundations of Eagles' eyries, or&ndash;especially by the smaller
  species&ndash;in long herbage. Exceptionally they are found under eaves. <i>Ploceipasser
  mahali</i> makes two "spouts," <i>Ploceus baya</i> counterpoises its pensile nursery with lumps of
  clay. The males add to the fabric after their consorts begin to incubate, and are asserted to make
  nests to sit in; the hens occasionally lay together, though the cocks are not proved to be
  polygamous. <i>Munia</i>, <i>Stictospiza</i>, <i>Sporaeginthus</i>, and in fact most Indian and
  Australian forms, deposit from five to seven dull white eggs; <i>Ploceus</i> lays two of a like
  description; <i>Ploce&euml;lla</i> two, which have a whitish or greyish ground with brown frecklings;
  the Ethiopian species about five, either plain white, blue, or green, or of the same colours,
  spotted and blotched with red or purplish-brown. In nests of <i>Hyphantornis</i> and
  <i>Pyromelaena</i> very diverse specimens are often found.</p>

  <p>Fam. XXXV. <b>Icteridae.</b>&ndash;This New World group comprises the "American Orioles" or
  "American Starlings," which are certainly not Orioles, though analogous to the Starlings, and
  allied through <i>Dolichonyx</i> to the Buntings. From the <i>Fringillidae</i> they are
  distinguished by the more elongated bill, which has no notch, and by the absence of rictal
  bristles. Dr. Sclater<a id="NtA_312" href="#Nt_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> recognises five
  Sub-families: <i>Cassicinae</i>, with long, straight, and often large bills, widening to a frontal
  shield; <i>Agelaeinae</i>, where they are conical with flattened culmen, being shortest in
  <i>Dolichonyx</i> and <i>Molobrus</i>; <i>Sturnellinae</i>, where they are more slender;
  <i>Icterinae</i> and <i>Quiscalinae</i>, where the culmen is rounded, the length and curvature
  varying more than elsewhere. <i>Aphobus</i> and <i>Curaeus</i> have grooved mandibles,
  <i>Gymnostinops</i> a naked space at their base, <i>Clype&iuml;cterus</i> <span class="pagenum"
  id="page580"><span class="smaller">{580}</span></span>a horny swelling there. The legs are stout,
  being long in the terrestrial Agelaeinae, Sturnellinae, and Quiscalinae, and not much shorter in
  the Icterinae and Cassicinae; <i>Dolichonyx</i> has the middle toe, and the Sturnellinae the
  hallux elongated. The wings are long or moderate, being often pointed with far-extended outer
  secondaries in the Sturnellinae. The tail varies in length and form, but is much graduated in the
  Quiscalinae (Boat-tails), which usually carry it in flight with the outer feathers uppermost; it
  has acuminate rectrices in the Sturnellinae, <i>Leistes</i>, and <i>Dolichonyx</i>, while in the
  last-named it is forked. <i>Cassiculus</i>, <i>Eurycorystes</i>, and some species of
  <i>Ostinops</i> have crests, the male of <i>Cassidix</i> a neck-frill, <i>Lampropsar</i> erect
  frontal plumes, the Sturnellinae bristly crown-feathers, <i>Hypopyrrhus</i>, <i>Curaeus</i>, and
  <i>Aphobus</i> lanceolate feathers on the head. <i>Gymnomystax</i> possesses naked orbits.</p>

  <p>The <i>Cassicinae</i>, or Cassiques, are sometimes uniform black, sometimes black relieved by
  chestnut, yellow, green, or scarlet; the bill being frequently white, instead of the usual black
  or brown. The Agelaeinae are generally black, varied with red and yellow, <i>Dolichonyx
  oryzivorus</i>, the Bobolink, being, however, black, brown, buff, and white, with a duller plumage
  in winter. The Sturnellinae are brown, variegated with black; having scarlet or canary yellow
  under parts, and in <i>Sturnella magna</i>, the "Meadow-Lark," a black gorget. The Icterinae (all
  but one of which belong to the extensive genus <i>Icterus</i>) are glossy black, with yellow, bay,
  or orange patches&ndash;especially upon the rump and lower surface&ndash;and often some white on
  the wing. The Quiscalinae are black, occasionally with metallic gloss, and scarlet or brown
  markings. The females are commonly similar to the males, especially in the Cassicinae, but are
  sometimes comparatively sombre. <i>Agelaeus phoeniceus</i>, the "Red-winged Starling," several
  males of which have been captured in Britain, <i>Icterus baltimore</i>, the "Baltimore Oriole" and
  <i>Quiscalus versicolor</i>, the "Crow-Blackbird," are good examples of their respective groups.
  The curious resemblance of <i>Sturnella</i> and <i>Macronyx</i> has already been mentioned (<span

  </div>

  <p>Some of the Family are large birds for Passeres, <i>Gymnostinops</i>, for instance, being the
  size of a Rook; they are commonly gregarious, and frequent forests or wooded country, the
  Agelaeinae and Sturnellinae in particular preferring open grassy places and marshes, and all
  seeming fond of the neighbourhood of water. The Cassicinae only range from South Mexico to
  Paraguay and Bolivia; but the other Sub-families occupy most of America, except the extreme north,
  the Quiscalinae extending to Chili and Argentina, the Sturnellinae to Patagonia. Several species
  are peculiar to the Antilles. The flight is sufficiently strong and swift, flocks of
  <i>Agelaeus</i> and <i>Quiscalus</i> performing evolutions like Starlings; while these forms,
  <i>Dolichonyx</i>, <i>Scolephagus</i>, <i>Xanthocephalus</i>, and others roost in huge companies
  on migration. These lively, active, and fairly tame birds differ considerably in habits,
  <i>Dolichonyx</i> sitting continually on fences, clinging to plant-stems, or hovering in the air,
  <i>Sturnella</i> sailing or fluttering with jerky movements, the Icterinae and Cassicinae being
  particularly accustomed to perch, and many forms walking well or even gracefully. The members of
  the genus <i>Icterus</i> have melodious voices, those of <i>I. vulgaris</i> and <i>I.
  baltimore</i> being especially rich and varied; they are therefore favourite cage-birds.
  <i>Dolichonyx</i>, perhaps the finest of American songsters, often sings in chorus;
  <i>Sturnella</i> produces tuneful, wild, but not powerful notes; the Cassicinae utter loud
  discordant cries or sweeter strains; while many forms chatter, chuckle, squeak, scream, or whistle
  more or less harshly, whether in the air, in the trees, or on the ground. The food in the breeding
  season consists almost entirely of insects, their larvae, and small molluscs; but fruit is also
  eaten, and havoc wrought in maize- and corn-fields, <i>Quiscalus</i> even pulling up the shooting
  blades. The terrestrial species often <span class="pagenum" id="page582"><span
  class="smaller">{582}</span></span>scratch amongst the soil, but the Icterinae and Cassicinae
  rarely feed upon the ground.</p>

  <p>The Agelaeinae build cup-shaped nests of grass, sedge, or rushes, sometimes lined with hair, in
  bushes or reeds, generally in damp or marshy spots; and lay five or six white, drab, greenish,
  bluish, or reddish eggs, with purple, black, red, or brown blotches, dots, and lines: the
  Quiscalinae deposit similar eggs in rougher structures of twigs, grass, and the like, placed in
  tree-forks or bushes. Both these groups often form societies. <i>Sturnella</i> hides its deep
  fabric in grass or rushes, the eggs being speckled rather than spotted; the Icterinae, or
  "Hang-nests," usually weave pensile nests of plant-stems, tendrils, grasses, or even rags, lined
  with wool, down, and so forth, which are rarely domed, and generally contain five or six eggs of a
  more delicate colouring than those of their kindred, varied by marblings, zigzags, streaks, and
  spots of brown, purple, black, or red. The Cassicinae commonly join in colonies and hang their
  elaborate, purse-like nurseries of grass or palm-fibres, <i>Tillandsia</i>, <i>Bromelia</i>, or
  lichens, lined with feathers, from branches above water; the two to five eggs are plain white, or
  greenish- bluish- or reddish-white, blotched, dotted, dashed, or scrawled with purplish- or
  reddish-brown and black.<a id="NtA_313" href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The gregarious Cow-birds (<i>Molobrus</i>), included in the Agelaeinae, lay eggs varying from
  white to pinkish, greenish, bluish, or brownish, often spotted or streaked with red, brown, and
  grey; one or more of these are by most species foisted in Cuckoo fashion upon other birds, the
  young of which disappear at an early date. It is a curious fact that <i>M. rufo-axillaris</i> is
  ordinarily parasitic on its congener <i>M. badius</i>, which itself seizes and uses other birds'
  nests. Many eggs are destroyed by the males, or are dropped promiscuously by the females, several
  of the latter often laying together. Cow-birds perch on cattle or follow the plough for insects,
  and utter ringing screams in concert.<a id="NtA_314" href="#Nt_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fam. XXXVI. <b>Fringillidae.</b>&ndash;The Finches are small birds very closely allied to the
  <i>Tanagridae</i> and the <i>Ploceidae</i>; while the Buntings are here included in the Family,
  though often separated as <i>Emberizidae</i>. The most evident points of distinction in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page583"><span class="smaller">{583}</span></span>last-named are the
  considerable deflection of the posterior portion of the angular gape and the bony knob often
  present on the palate; a gap, moreover, commonly occurs between the edges of the maxilla and the
  mandible. Extreme forms are thus easily recognised, but it seems almost impossible to draw an
  exact line of demarcation, even when the more Lark-like nest of Buntings and their streaky eggs
  are taken into consideration. The <i>Fringillidae</i> predominate in the Palaearctic Region, but
  are fairly plentiful elsewhere, except in the Australian Region, whence few are as yet recorded;
  many forms, however, have very limited ranges; while some are peculiar to certain islands, as
  <i>Geospiza</i>, <i>Camarhynchus</i>, and <i>Cactornis</i> to the Gal&aacute;pagos, <i>Passer
  jago&euml;nsis</i> to the Cape Verds, <i>Chaunoproctus</i> to the Bonin Islands and <i>Telespiza</i> to
  the Laysan group, <i>Nesospiza</i> to Tristan da Cunha, <i>Melopyrrha</i> to Cuba,
  <i>Rhynchostruthus</i> and <i>Passer insularis</i> to Socotra.</p>

  <p>The bill is usually stout and cone-shaped, often with a notched maxilla, occasionally with a
  ridged culmen; it is enormous in <i>Geospiza</i>, <i>Camarhynchus</i>, <i>Chaunoproctus</i>, and
  some other forms, and highly developed in <i>Coccothraustes</i>, <i>Pyrrhula</i>, and elsewhere;
  but is at times either remarkably short, or longer and more slender, as in <i>Cactornis</i>,
  <i>Chrysomitris</i>, and <i>Carduelis</i>. Frequently it is curved, with overhanging tip, while a
  peculiar crossing of the mandibles at their extremities marks the genus <i>Loxia</i>. An excessive
  summer growth has been especially noticed in Redpolls, which is worn down by hard food in winter.
  The beak is seldom abnormal in Buntings. The metatarsus is moderate; but in <i>Calcarius</i>,
  <i>Plectrophenax</i>, <i>Nesospiza</i>, and <i>Chamaeospiza</i> the hind claw is elongated, as is
  the mid-claw in <i>Phonipara</i>. The wings, which have a minute outer primary, vary from very
  long, as in <i>Hesperiphona</i>, to short as in <i>Passer</i>, and from pointed, as in
  <i>Plectrophenax</i>, to rounded as in <i>Ammodramus</i>; the secondaries are shaped like a
  bill-hook in <i>Coccothraustes</i>, while the inner are much lengthened in <i>Emberiza fucata</i>.
  The tail is fairly normal, but may be long or decidedly short, square, round, graduated, or
  forked; the rectrices are unusually acute in <i>Spiza</i>, <i>Coryphospiza</i>, and
  <i>Emberizo&iuml;des</i>. Many species possess a crop. Bristles generally occur at the gape, and the
  nostrils are concealed by feathers or by a membrane.</p>

  <p>The sexes may be similarly coloured or very different, the hues being commonly sober, but
  sometimes particularly brilliant. <i>Cardinalis</i>, <i>Paroaria</i>, <i>Gubernatrix</i>,
  <i>Melophus</i>, <i>Pyrrhuloxia</i>, <i>Schistospiza</i>, <i>Lophospingus</i>, and <i>Tiaris</i>
  have fine crests; <i>Catamblyrhynchus</i> exhibits stiff crown-feathers. The feet are usually
  dull, but occasionally pinkish, as in <i>Embernagra</i> and <i>Pycnorhamphus</i>; the bill may be
  blackish, yellowish, dusky, or even red, as in <i>Cardinalis</i> (except one form). Of British
  species, the Greenfinch (<i>Ligurinus chloris</i>), the Goldfinch (<i>Carduelis elegans</i>), the
  Sparrow (<i>Passer domesticus</i>), the Chaffinch (<i>Fringilla coelebs</i>), the Brambling (<i>F.
  montifringilla</i>), the Linnet (<i>Linota cannabina</i>), the Redpoll (<i>Aegiothus
  rufescens</i>), the Bullfinch (<i>Pyrrhula europaea</i>), the Reed-Bunting (<i>Emberiza
  schoeniclus</i>), the Corn-Bunting (<i>E. miliaria</i>), and the Yellow Hammer (<i>E.
  citrinella</i>) hardly need description; while several others occur more rarely in our islands or
  breed with us in limited numbers, such as the Hawfinch (<i>Coccothraustes vulgaris</i>), which is
  bay, black and white; the Siskin (<i>Chrysomitris spinus</i>) and the Serin (<i>Serinus
  hortulanus</i>), which are chiefly greenish-yellow; the Pine-Grosbeak (<i>Pyrrhula enucleator</i>)
  and the Crossbill (<i>Loxia curvirostra</i>), which are mainly red in the adult male, and
  respectively yellow and greenish-orange in the female; the Ortolan Bunting (<i>Emberiza
  hortulana</i>), which is brown, green, and yellow; and the Snow-Bunting (<i>Plectrophenax
  nivalis</i>), with its black, chestnut, and <span class="pagenum" id="page585"><span
  class="smaller">{585}</span></span>white plumage, that becomes black and white in summer. The
  Rose-Finches (<i>Carpodacus</i>) of the Eastern Palaearctic, the Nearctic, and the Indian Regions
  exhibit fine crimson or rosy tints; the Central and South American <i>Pheucticus</i>, and the
  Western North American <i>Hesperiphona</i>, much black and yellow; the Cardinals
  (<i>Cardinalis</i>), of North America, Venezuela, and Trinidad, bright red with black forehead and
  throat; <i>Paroaria</i>, which replaces the last-named genus southwards, somewhat like colours.
  <i>Guiraca</i> of most of America, except the extreme north and south, is mainly blue;
  <i>Cyanospiza cyanea</i>, ranging from the Eastern United States to Panama, is even more
  brilliant; while the Painted Bunting (<i>C. ciris</i>), of similar range, shews a beautiful
  combination of blue, red, brown, and yellowish-green. <i>Volatinia</i> of Central and South
  America is black; <i>Geospiza</i>, <i>Camarhynchus</i>, and <i>Cactornis</i> are the same, or
  decidedly dull; <i>Petronia brachydactyla</i> and <i>Passer simplex</i>, of the deserts from North
  Africa to Persia, resemble the sand in tint. The wild Canary (<i>Serinus canarius</i>) of Madeira,
  the Azores, and the Canaries&ndash;not to be confounded with the Cape Canary (<i>S.
  canicollis</i>)&ndash;is greenish above with brown striations, and yellowish below. Finally, many
  sober-hued North American genera, such as <i>Pipilo</i>, <i>Peucaea</i>, and <i>Junco</i>, lead up
  to the brown-streaked Bunting forms.</p>

  <p>The crimson tints exhibited by the adult male Linnet, when in breeding plumage, afford a
  well-known instance of seasonal change of colour. It is in consequence indifferently called the
  Red, Brown, or Grey Linnet.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page586"><span class="smaller">{586}</span></span></div>

  <p>The members of this Family generally frequent wooded districts and open grassy spots, Finches
  on the whole preferring the former, Buntings the latter; a few occupy sandy deserts;
  <i>Petronia</i> haunts rocks; <i>Ammodramus</i> resorts to the shore. This bird clings to the
  reeds like a Tit, a habit well-known to be shared by various other marsh-loving species.
  <i>Camarhynchus</i> and <i>Geospiza</i> accompany flocks of Doves to dry bushy and rocky spots
  near the sea in the Gal&aacute;pagos. The majority are active and lively birds, social and seldom shy,
  which flock in winter to feed or roost; while the pugnacity of the Sparrow is rather exceptional.
  They not only dust themselves in dry spots, but bathe freely. <i>Montifringilla</i> breeds in
  mountainous places, <i>Leucosticte</i> and <i>Plectrophenax</i> in similar situations, or on rocky
  Arctic shores. The flight is ordinarily strong and rapid, some species of <i>Sycalis</i>,
  <i>Phrygilus</i>, and <i>Calamospiza</i> soaring, and descending with outspread wings;
  <i>Cactornis</i> climbs with ease about the prickly pear (<i>Opuntia</i>), while many Finches hop
  well, and others run readily and swiftly. The song is often exceptionally fine, as in the Canary,
  Linnet, Cardinal, American Song-Sparrow (<i>Melospiza</i>), <i>Chondestes</i>, <i>Zonotrichia</i>,
  and elsewhere; the Bullfinch in the wild state has a plaintive pipe; while the chirp of Sparrows
  may be contrasted with the Cricket-like strain of <i>Petronia brachydactyla</i>, the whistling cry
  of the Snow-finch (<i>Montifringilla nivalis</i>), the long-drawn note of the Corn-Bunting, or the
  sibilant sound at times made by the Crossbill. The food consists mainly of seeds, but other
  fruits, buds, leaves, insects and their larvae, are also eaten, not to mention peas, crocus
  flowers, and the like; Crossbills and some other forms cleverly extract the seeds of fir-cones,
  <i>Camarhynchus</i> and <i>Geospiza</i> scratch about upon the ground, and <i>Cactornis</i>
  devours seeds and flowers of the <i>Opuntia</i>. The nest varies from the huge, untidy domed mass
  of straw and feathers fashioned by Sparrows to the small compact cup of moss, wool, hair, down,
  lichen, and such materials, formed by the Goldfinch, Redpoll, or Chaffinch; Hawfinches and
  Bullfinches make shallow structures chiefly composed of twigs and lined with roots; the British
  Buntings build with grass and horse-hair if possible; <i>Phonipara</i> and other species sometimes
  make covered fabrics; <i>Sycalis pelzelni</i> occasionally utilizes nests of other birds. The site
  may be in a tree, bush, rock, building, or on the ground, some forms nidificating under cover,
  some in the open. Sparrows have black, grey, and white eggs; those of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page587"><span class="smaller">{587}</span></span>the Linnet, the Goldfinch, and their allies
  are blue, bluish-white, or greenish, with reddish or brownish spots; those of Buntings are
  whitish, greenish, or ruddy, with brown, blackish, or rufous marks, ordinarily including streaks
  and scrawls; those of <i>Petronia brachydactyla</i> are white with blackish blotches; those of the
  Hawfinch green with olive and umber spots or lines; those of the Snow-finch white; those of
  <i>Spiza guiraca</i> and some other American species plain bluish or greenish.</p>

  <p class="sp5">With the Fringillidae this volume ends, according to the Classification which has
  been here adopted; but it may be well to take the opportunity of again reminding the reader that
  the "Families" of Oscines are not of equal rank to those of the Orders which precede them; and
  that, as regards the arrangement of these "Families," few writers will be found to agree; the
  truth being that there never can be a perfectly satisfactory linear system, since affinities point
  in so many different directions. When all these affinities have been finally investigated by
  anatomists, if ever that time should come, they may very possibly necessitate an alphabetical
  arrangement of the groups, with indications of their various relationships under each head.</p>

    <p><i>CAMBRIDGE REVIEW.</i>&ndash;"Several of the groups treated of in this volume are unknown
    by sight even to the general reader, and possess no popular name whatsoever; and as only a few
    insignificant details are known of the habits of the animals composing them, their treatment in
    the volume before us has necessarily been to a large extent anatomical. This circumstance
    renders the book of especial value to students, more particularly as in some cases the articles
    on the groups in question are the first comprehensive ones dealing with their respective
    subjects.... Most of the articles are of a very high order of merit&ndash;taken as a whole, it
    may be said that they are by far the best which have as yet been published.... We may say with
    confidence that the same amount of information, within the same compass, is to be had in no
    other zoological work."</p>
    <p><i>GUARDIAN.</i>&ndash;"Taken as a whole, the articles are by far the best that have been
    written on their respective subjects, and the present volume will have a high value for
    zoological students besides its attractions for the general reader."</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>NATURAL SCIENCE.</i>&ndash;"This second volume of the Cambridge Natural
    History is certain to prove a most welcome addition to English Zoological literature. It deals
    with a series of animal groups, all deeply interesting to the specialist in morphology; some
    important from their economic relations to other living things, others in their life-histories
    rivalling the marvels of fairy-tales. And the style in which they are here treated is also
    interesting; history and the early observations of the older writers lend their charm; accounts
    of habits and mode of occurrence, of life, in a word, from the cradle to the grave, are given in
    ample detail, accompanied by full references to modern and current literature. The whole is
    admirably illustrated."</p>

    <p><i>TIMES.</i>&ndash;"There are very many, not only among educated people who take an interest
    in science, but even among specialists, who will welcome a work of reasonable compass and handy
    form containing a trustworthy treatment of the various departments of Natural History by men who
    are familiar with, and competent to deal with, the latest results of scientific research.
    Altogether, to judge from this first volume, the Cambridge Natural History promises to fulfil
    all the expectations that its prospectus holds out."</p>
    <p><i>FIELD.</i>&ndash;"We know of no book available to the general reader which affords such a
    vast fund of information on the structure and habits of molluscs."</p>
    <p><i>KNOWLEDGE.</i>&ndash;"If succeeding volumes are like this one, the Cambridge Natural
    History will rank as one of the finest works on natural history ever published."</p>
    <p><i>ATHEN&AElig;UM.</i>&ndash;"The series certainly ought not to be restricted in its circulation to

    <p>The integument of a Bird consists of Skin and Feathers, the former being composed of a
    superficial <i>epidermis</i> and an underlying <i>derma</i> or <i>cutis</i>, which is rich in
    sensory organs but poor in blood-vessels. The epidermis itself has a horny outer layer and a
    softer (Malpighian) substratum. Feathers, hairs, bristles, scales, claws and bill-sheaths are
    epidermal structures.</p>

    <p>Of this nature are zoomelanin (black), zoonerythrin (red), zooxanthin (yellow), turacin
    (red&ndash;only known in the <i>Musophagidae</i>), and perhaps turacoverdin (green, from the
    same family). Brown is produced by a combination of red and black; white is the appearance due

    <p>Albinism is due to the absence of pigment; melanism, xanthochroism and erythrism are terms
